            "description": "Attorney General Garland taps a special counsel to investigate classified documents found in President Biden's old office and home. MSNBC Chief legal correspondent Ari Melber reports on how Garland \"upended\" Washington D.C. with this surprise announcement. Melber calls it \"a significant legal development, no matter what happens.\" The announcement coming after the ongoing review spilled into the press, raising questions about whether the DOJ or Garland are responding to events other than the law itself.",

            "content": "Meyers Leonard, who has been gone from the NBA for nearly two years, will work out for the Lakers on Friday, The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported.\n\nLeonard, who spent his first seven years with the Trail Blazers before two with the Heat, hasn’t been in the league since March 2021 when he used an anti-Semitic slur during a live video game stream. Miami suspended him indefinitely after the incident, then traded him to the Thunder as salary filler as part of the Trevor Ariza trade, with Oklahoma City immediately releasing the 7-footer.\n\nHe was ultimately suspended for a week by the NBA and fined $50,000 and later apologized.\n\nWith Anthony Davis still sidelined with a stress injury to his right foot, the Lakers have been looking for a big man to help with spacing — they are also working out former All-Star DeMarcus Cousins on Friday.\n\nIt’s also not the first time a player accused of anti-Semitism has been connected to the Lakers.\n\nIn the offseason, L.A. pursued a trade for Kyrie Irving. The Nets star was later suspended after linking to an anti-Semitic movie on social media.\n\nIrving, who will be a free agent this summer, ended up missing eight games for the Nets amid the controversy and since his return has helped spark the Nets to the second-best record in the East.\n\nLeonard, 30, last played in an NBA game on Jan. 9, 2021 against the Wizards and underwent ankle surgery in April of that year, then suffered from nerve damage in the bottom half of his right leg due to the procedure. He averaged 5.9 points, 3.9 rebounds and shot 39 percent from the 3-point line for his career.",

            "description": "The Giants (9-7-1), who face the Vikings at U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday, are in the playoffs for the first time since the 2016 season.",
            "content": "The Giants (9-7-1), in the playoffs for the first time since the 2016 season, finished third in the NFC East after going 0-4 against the Eagles and Cowboys. At one point, first-year head coach Brian Daboll looked like the NFL's darling after guiding New York to a 6-1 start — all one-score games. The Giants narrowly won by dominating the turnover margin with solid-enough defense.\n\nRunning back Saquon Barkley's resurgence has been the story of New York's season. He burst out of the gate with 194 yards from scrimmage in Week 1 against the Titans.\n\nBut Daboll, the ex-Bills offensive coordinator, has yet to find consistency on offense. Quarterback Daniel Jones and Daboll have struggled to keep the Giants in games. Since their hot start, the Giants are 0-6-1 when their opponents score 20 points or more. All six losses came against NFC foes: the Seahawks, Lions, Cowboys, Eagles (twice) and Vikings.\n\nThey're stumbling into the playoffs with a 3-6-1 finish to the regular season, ultimately middling on both sides of the ball with the 15th-ranked scoring offense and 17th-ranked scoring defense.\n\nJones rode big plays to keep the Giants within reach during the Vikings' 27-24 win on Dec. 24, ended by kicker Greg Joseph's franchise-best 61-yard field goal in the closing seconds. Jones' 334 passing yards against Minnesota was his second-highest total of the season. He attacked the perimeter of the Vikings defense with throws gaining at least 29 yards to receivers Darius Slayton, Richie James and Isaiah Hodgins.\n\nBarkley finished strong with a 27-yard touchdown run up the middle on fourth down, which tied the game at 24-24 in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins was also efficient. He led three scoring drives in the fourth quarter while finishing with 299 yards and three touchdowns, relying on receiver Justin Jefferson (12 catches, 133 yards, a touchdown) and tight end T.J. Hockenson (13 catches, 109 yards, two touchdowns).\n\nThe Vikings and Giants haven't met in the postseason since the worst playoff defeat in Vikings history — 41-0 or \"41-doughnut\" — in the NFC Championship game during the 2000 season. The Vikings' fifth-ranked offense — with quarterback Daunte Culpepper and receivers Randy Moss and Cris Carter — had the ball for only 17½ of 60 minutes.\n\nThat year's 28th-ranked defense couldn't get off the field. The Vikings gave up 518 yards, led by Giants quarterback Kerry Collins to receiver Ike Hilliard, who had 10 grabs for 155 yards and two scores.\n\nThat was the third postseason meeting in eight years between the 1993-2000 seasons; the Vikings are 1-2 in the playoff series. The Giants are seeking their franchise's first playoff win since the 2011 Super Bowl run.\n\nThe Giants offense runs — and it runs through Barkley, whose 1,650 yards from scrimmage are his most since the standout rookie year. Daboll and offensive coordinator Mike Kafka have designed a versatile rushing attack between Barkley and Jones, whose 120 rushing attempts nearly doubled his previous high in 2020.\n\nThe Giants have leaned into Jones' mobility with zone-read option runs and run-pass options (RPOs), stressing a Vikings front that traded blows with Jones last month.\n\n\"We got to keep contain,\" edge rusher Za'Darius Smith said. \"That quarterback can run.\"\n\nSmith and edge rusher Danielle Hunter tied a season high with seven combined hits on Jones, who also escaped for three successful runs that gained two first downs and set up Barkley's fourth-down touchdown run.\n\nWhether through quick RPOs or longer play-action bootlegs, Jones often fakes a handoff before he throws. He attacked the middle of the Vikings defense last month, completing 9 of 12 play-action throws for 109 yards and a score. Jones completed so many play-action throws over the middle that Vikings cornerback Patrick Peterson said he'd jump the next one, predicting his fourth-quarter interception.\n\nDefensive coordinator Ed Donatell cranked up the heat on Jones, who took 11 hits (three sacks) and had four passes deflected. Linebacker Eric Kendricks batted away Jones' initial third-down throw while blitzing. Daboll uncharacteristically called more Giants passes than runs against a porous Vikings defense that ended the year allowing the most explosive passing plays — 61 for at least 20 yards — outside of the Tennessee Titans' 63.\n\n\"I think we've made improvements there, I really do,\" Donatell said. \"The numbers have come down, the third downs look good.\"\n\n\"Putting it all together is what we intend to do this week,\" he added.\n\nThere are few certainties in matchups between NFL coaches spending all week trying to catch the other off guard. But the Vikings can safely expect veteran Giants defensive coordinator Wink Martindale to blitz, blitz and blitz some more.\n\nNo NFL defense blitzed more than the Giants (39.7%) during the regular season, according to Pro Football Reference. During the Vikings' Dec. 24 win over the Giants, coordinator Wes Phillips figured that pressure got to Cousins about half the time as he took 11 hits (four sacks). But Cousins often carved up the Giants with underneath throws and a 71% completion rate, which required quick decisions and a lot of studying Martindale's deep catalogue of blitz designs. Even more could fall on Cousins' shoulders if No. 3 center Chris Reed remains in the starting lineup.\n\n\"I feel like [Martindale] has a book about this big,\" said Phillips, holding his hands apart, \"and he just pulls out sheets and decides which ones.\"\n\nThe Giants defense is healthier this time around after resting most starters in the regular season finale. Safety Xavier McKinney is back from a two-month absence and Adoree' Jackson — New York's top cornerback — could return from a knee injury for the first time since Nov. 20. Interior defenders Leonard Williams and Dexter Lawrence also form a tough duo who can defeat solo blocks.\n\nNew York holds steady in the red zone, where they allow the fifth-stingiest touchdown rate, according to Football Outsiders. But the Giants have surrendered many big plays. The blitz-heavy approach makes them susceptible to leaks, allowing 64 plays to gain at least 20 yards — nearly four per game.\n\nThe Giants also go for the knockout. They pressure quarterbacks at a top-five rate and try to physically restrain receivers (11 defensive holding flags trail only New Orleans). And only the Cowboys have forced more fumbles than the Giants. Edge rushers Azeez Ojulari and Kayvon Thibodeaux have combined for five strip-sacks while passers worry about pressure that can come from anywhere.\n\n\"It's a good defense,\" Cousins said, \"and will require a lot of preparation.\"\n\nDaboll, 47, is in his first year as an NFL head coach after a winding path as offensive coordinator for Miami, Cleveland and Buffalo. He put together a veteran coaching staff, including Martindale, the 59-year-old defensive play caller, and 49-year-old special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who has been with the Giants since 2018. Daboll hasn't been an overly aggressive game manager on fourth down.\n\nThe Giants are one of the more penalized teams in the league, particularly with pre-snap infractions on offense; only the Cardinals had more in the regular season. Former Vikings defensive coordinator Andre Patterson is the Giants defensive line coach.",

            "description": "It may seem counterintuitive, but Attorney General Merrick Garland’s decision will only serve to frustrate Republican efforts to weaponize Congressional oversight hearings.",
            "content": "Attorney General Merrick Garland probably did not need to appoint a special counsel to investigate the discovery of a small number of classified documents dating from President Biden’s tenure as vice president—but his decision will ultimately frustrate Republican efforts to weaponize Congressional oversight hearings.\n\nThe Justice Department’s special counsel regulations require the Attorney General to first determine that a “criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted” before appointing a special counsel—and such a determination would seem unjustified, at least from publicly known facts.\n\nGarland also reminded the American public today that he fully believes DOJ would be capable of investigating any matter with independence and integrity, but this is the second time in less than two months that Garland has appointed a special counsel.\n\nThe facts surrounding Garland’s appointment of Jack Smith to investigate Trump’s classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago and his ties to Jan. 6 seem so different from the discovery of a small number of classified documents at President Biden’s former private office (and also at his Wilmington, Delaware residence) that the appointment of Robert Hur to investigate the Biden matter seems hard to justify–at least from the outside looking in, without the benefit of what Garland may have learned from the preliminary investigation that had been conducted by a Trump hold-over prosecutor.\n\nBut Garland’s decision may have also been influenced by his time as a top DOJ official during the tenure of Attorney General Janet Reno, when a different law existed for appointing special counsels – known under the law then as Independent Counsels – that expired in 1999.\n\nRecall that Reno ultimately appointed seven independent counsels to investigate various officials and cases during the Clinton administration, including the notorious one led by Ken Starr that fueled impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.\n\nUnder the law in effect during Reno’s tenure, the Attorney General was tasked to do a preliminary investigation to determine whether appointment of an Independent Counsel was necessary. These investigations could be extensive. The preliminary investigation conducted into campaign finance laws Vice President Gore had potentially violated required an appointment of an Independent Counsel and took thousands of hours.\n\nNo such preliminary investigation is specified under the current DOJ regulations, but Garland had appointed a Trump hold-over United States Attorney – John Lausch – to conduct an initial investigation, and referenced Lausch’s recommendation as the basis for his decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate the actions of a sitting President.\n\nIronically, the Clinton era law had been championed by President Clinton – and initially supported by Reno – because Clinton believed the law would be a “foundation stone for the trust between the Government and our citizens.” He dismissed notions that the law had been a “tool of partisan attack …and a waste of taxpayer funds” – words Clinton no doubt rued later in his Presidency.\n\nAG Reno ultimately withdrew her support for the law, testifying to Congress that the law had been destroyed by being “plunged into the political process.”\n\nAG Garland’s two back-to-back decisions to appoint special counsel must be viewed with the context of his formative experience at the Clinton-era DOJ under Reno, who was the only attorney general throughout Clinton’s presidency. Garland would have seen both the heady idealism underlying the old law, as well as how far off the rails it would go when wielded by partisan personalities like Ken Starr.\n\nThen as now, Republican members of Congress sought to attack a Democratic administration calling the failure to prosecute such issues as Vice President Gore’s fundraising actions a “cover-up” and calling for Congressional investigations.\n\nBut the legion of Independent Counsels during the Clinton era also served as a bulwark against partisan abuse of Congressional oversight, because the investigations shielded the work of prosecutors from Congress.\n\nCertainly, Garland’s decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate the Biden document matter can be second-guessed by those of us who do not have knowledge of what the preliminary investigation showed. And many will rightfully criticize the parallel this sets up between Trump’s actions and Biden’s actions. But what cannot be debated is that by appointing a special counsel Garland has provided the best protection possible from partisan weaponized use of Congressional investigations that are promised by the new Republican led House of Representatives.\n\nThe newly formed Select Committee under the House Judiciary Committee will find its efforts to “oversee”—read: interfere with—active criminal investigations thwarted by the existence of an active Special Counsel investigation given DOJ’s historic resistance to speaking about active investigations.\n\nGrand jury work – typically a part of almost every criminal investigation – will provide further protection since it is governed by rules of secrecy that prevent the government from speaking about the matters before it.\n\nIn contrast, if Garland had simply exercised his authority and determined that no special counsel criminal investigation was warranted, then House Republican investigations would have had greater leverage, since they would have been seeking to investigate a closed matter.\n\nNow those House members will be left only with such legitimate oversight questions, like whether there is proper classification of documents and just how up-to-date the National Security apparatus is at tracking the massive amounts of classified information it generates. Important questions for sure, but hardly as attractive to a Republican House more interested in accusations than governance.",

            "content": "ALBANY — Unions and environmental groups are joining forces to call on Gov. Hochul and lawmakers to make all state-run buildings and facilities fully green by 2040 with the help of organized labor.\n\nA coalition called #UpgradeNY is hoping to help the state curb greenhouse gas emissions produced by government-run buildings and provide union jobs to New Yorkers from communities most impacted by climate change and pollution.\n\nLisa Dix, New York director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition, said the group represents “a new era of labor-led climate action.”\n\n“Together, we can create the long-term certainty to decarbonize our buildings at the scale needed to achieve New York’s climate goals, coupled with a pipeline of projects that builds a local, union clean energy workforce,” Dix added.\n\nThe coalition is asking the governor and Legislature to commit to decarbonize at least 15 of New York’s highest polluting facilities by 2030, which could reduce pollution produced by state-run buildings by roughly 40%.\n\nThe Empire State Plaza complex in Albany, SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and the City College of New York are among the sites the group would like to see prioritized.\n\nAccording to the proposal, projects must be shovel ready by 2025 and achieve at least a 30% reduction of on-site emissions from the state-owned buildings portfolio, which includes SUNY and CUNY campuses and government buildings.\n\n“The State must lead by example,” said Julie Tighe, president of the New York League of Conservation Voters. “This is a tremendous opportunity to reduce emissions, provide a cleaner environment for students attending state universities and create good paying jobs.”\n\nHochul floated several similar climate-friendly proposals in her State of the State address earlier this week that would help New York in achieving the emission reduction goals established by the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.\n\nNew York is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050, under the CLCPA. A sweeping scoping plan that could serve as a blueprint for New York’s greener future was approved late last month by the State Climate Action Council, made up of state officials and appointees.\n\nSome of the ideas put forth by the governor include a “cap and invest” plan that would require businesses to buy allowances to pollute and gradually reduces limits over time.\n\nHochul also called for a ban on burning fossil fuels in newly constructed buildings within five years.\n\nSeveral SUNY and CUNY campuses have already begun eyeing ways to reduce pollution. The City College of New York announced last year the school is working with the federal Department of Energy’s Building Technology Office and the city on the development of advanced heat pump systems.\n\nHochul signed an executive order last fall meant to help streamline the efforts of state agencies to reduce pollution by setting new environmental performance goals as the state seeks to reach “net zero” emissions over the next decade and a half.\n\nA spokeswoman for the governor did not say whether Hochul would support the new push, but said the administration “continues to take bold actions to address climate change because we’re not just the first generation to feel the effects, we’re also the last generation that can do something to combat it.”\n\nLabor leaders said focusing on state-run facilities could be a boon for workers from communities that have historically seen the worst impacts of pollution.\n\nThe proposal includes requiring Project Labor Agreements for large-scale projects, Labor Peace protections, and funding from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority’s workforce development program for direct entry pre-apprenticeship programs as well as programs for existing workers.\n\n“As we look to restart the economy, we must focus on delivering union careers with family-sustaining wages to New Yorkers across the state,” said Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York. “This proposal has taken every step to ensure that the jobs created from this important initiative will accomplish that.”",

(AP Photo/Vincent Thian)\n\nAfter three years of isolation and financial struggles in Chinese soccer the country is reopening its borders and economy to the outside world. With it, frustrated fans, financially-challenged clubs and unpaid players in the Chinese Super League might receive some long-awaited good news.\n\nThe 2022 season was unrecognizable from the 2019 edition, the last before COVID-19 hit. Then the league had an average attendance of over 24,000, the highest in Asia, and a number of big-name foreign imports.\n\nFrom 2020 onwards, Beijing’s ‘zero-covid’ policy, designed to stamp out the virus, meant that teams mostly played in empty stadiums at centralized venues. Players were stuck in bio-secure bubbles for months on end and international stars, unable to enter the country, were released from contracts.\n\nIt also meant little ticket, broadcast or sponsorship revenue for clubs. In 2021, defending champion Jiangsu FC folded and several other clubs have struggled to pay players.\n\nOpening up the country may not mean a return to the carefree spending of the previous decade but is a prerequisite to starting the journey back to pre-pandemic levels. It is reported that clubs will play home and away games in the 2023 season.\n\n“It almost feels like there has been no league in the past three years with delays, months without games and strange schedules,” Shanghai Shenhua supporter Wang Yi told The Associated Press. “Some fans have lost interest but I think that will change when we can all get together at the stadium again.”\n\nDue to the government’s strict policies, foreign teams were unable to enter the country, forcing China to play 2022 World Cup qualifiers in neutral venues. It finished next to last in its final qualification group, eight points behind Oman. The country was scheduled to host the 2023 Asian Cup in June but last May, Beijing relinquished its staging rights.\n\n“It remains to be seen if and how quickly Chinese football can return to its ambitions and plans of 2019, and prior to that.” Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport and Geopolitical Economy at Skema Business School , told the AP, adding that state help will be needed.\n\n“It is important that the sport doesn’t just restart, but that it is kick-started . . . there must be a worry that unless both the government and Chinese football commit themselves to refreshing and relaunching it, then the sport could get stuck in the international doldrums.”\n\nThe pandemic also exacerbated a downturn in China’s overheated property market. With more than half of the clubs in the top tier owned, at least in part, by real estate companies, it has been a major soccer issue.\n\nEvergrande, the property developer, saw its club Guangzhou, who won eight titles in the previous decade, relegated in December after the team’s stars left and were replaced by young domestic players.\n\nOpening up the country is expected to boost the housing market especially as, in December, Chinese state banks opened up a line of credit worth around $460 billion for real estate companies. It remains to be seen if this will ease the financial strain on clubs.\n\n“One suspects that the Chinese government will be keen to decouple football from its previous unhealthy relationship with property investors,” added Chadwick. “Both sectors need to discover some market discipline whilst being subject to the state’s appropriate guidance.”\n\nFor now though, fans just want to go and see their teams play.\n\n“I won’t believe it until it happens,” said Wang. “It is when something disappears that you know how much it means. It will be very exciting.”",

            "description": "Cheryl Bosa's sons play for the 49ers and Chargers, and she wasn't shy about her thoughts...",
            "content": "Not only did San Francisco 49ers fans get all-everything running back Christian McCaffrey in one of the greatest mid-season trades in NFL history, but they also — almost as importantly — got Lisa McCaffrey, Christian's mom.\n\nLisa McCaffrey, a former soccer player at Stanford, almost immediately endeared herself to the Niners fan base, making jokes at her son's expense, revealing the truth behind head coach Kyle Shanahan babysitting Christian as a teen and dropping F-bombs on live TV at every turn.\n\nOn Wednesday though, she passed the baton to Nick Bosa's mom, Cheryl. Appearing on the podcast \"Your Mom,\" which Lisa McCaffrey co-hosts with Ashley Adamson, Cheryl Bosa spent more than an hour oversharing about everything from drug testing her kids (\"We would drug test them, yeah, definitely. Listen, you’ve got a gift and kids are stupid. It’s our job to help them not be stupid,\" she said), to Nick having Ohio State colors on his braces growing up, to the Bosa house calling sacks \"Squishies\" — a reference to a \"Finding Nemo\" scene where Dory finds a jellyfish, calls him Squishy and obsessively wants to hug him (like Nick with opposing quarterbacks?).\n\nBut Bosa also shared some hard truths, specifically about how the 49ers franchise compares to the one Nick's brother Joey plays for: the Los Angeles Chargers, who travel to Jacksonville on Saturday for a 5:15 p.m. wild-card game against the Jaguars.\n\n\"Joey loves his teammates, don’t get me wrong, but the Chargers ain't the 49ers,\" she said. \"Lisa, I don't know if you know from experience because you've been on different teams, there's a difference between teams.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah. Absolutely,\" McCaffrey replied. \"Christian had been on the Panthers for six years, a lot of great people, there's been great coaches that came through, but for some reason couldn't get it together. After going to the Niners, he gets it now. He gets why. Like you have Nick sitting there after the game talking to Trent Williams asking him, 'What can I do better?' These are two of the best players in the whole NFL trying to get better.\"\n\nEven the game day experience is far superior in Santa Clara, according to Mama Bosa.\n\n\"When you go to a 49ers game, everything is right there,\" Bosa said. \"The team is at the hotel where the parents are staying — it’s like being in college. It's just this fantastic tailgate wonderful thing. In LA, it's who's here, who's there, the player doesn't walk into a hotel with fans cheering going crazy, they just walk in.\"\n\nHer preference for the Niners franchise aside, though, Bosa said she'll be at her son Joey's game on Saturday, not Nick's.\n\n\"Joey's been injured a lot this year, been out for 10 to 12 weeks. I went to his first game back two weeks ago. I guess it's just a numbers game, I need to be there for him. I adore his girlfriend so she's thrilled, she's flying from California with me. [I] went out to dinner [with Nick] after the game on Sunday, and I just said, 'Babe, I’m really sorry, I’m going to go Joey’s game.' And he was like, 'Absolutely.'\"\n\nGood news though for 49ers fans (and maybe bad news for TV networks that need to hit the bleep button on profanity): Lisa McCaffrey will be on hand Sunday to cheer on Christian as the Niners begin their playoff journey at 1:30 p.m. when they host the Seattle Seahawks.",

            "description": "Republicans are demanding to see the \"visitor logs\" from President Biden's private home in Delaware, although it is unclear whether such logs exist.",
            "content": "Republicans are speculating that the classified documents kept by President Joe Biden at his Delaware home may have been reviewed by the president's son Hunter Biden.\n\nThe White House confirmed on Thursday that classified documents dating back to the Obama administration had been found at the president's private residence in Wilmington.\n\nThat revelation came only days after it was announced that an initial batch of classified documents from Biden's time as vice president had been found in an office at Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nBiden defended the discovery at his private home by insisting that he treats \"classified materials seriously\" and noting that the documents were inside a \"locked\" garage. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to look into the Biden document finds later in the day.\n\nRepublicans have argued that there is a double standard regarding the mishandling of government records. Some have demanded that the FBI raid Biden's home to look for more classified documents, as happened last summer at the Mar-a-Lago home of former President Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing the new discovery in Delaware, a number of prominent conservatives floated conspiracy-laden suggestions that Hunter Biden may have seen the documents, although there is no evidence to suggest that he did.\n\n\"Given his extensive ties to China, Russia, and Ukraine, did Hunter Biden have access to Joe Biden's garage and therefore the classified documents?\" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted.\n\n\"Gosh I hope Biden didn't let Hunter drive the Corvette,\" tweeted conservative commentator Liz Wheeler. \"Hunter might've found the classified documents. Have we checked Hunter's naked crack-smoking Russian hooker videos for Biden's classified documents yet?\"\n\n\"Did Hunter Biden get a look at the classified documents about Ukraine his father happened to have laying around his Corvette?\" conservative author and activist Brigitte Gabriel tweeted. \"The American people deserve to know.\"\n\nSome also demanded that the White House release \"visitor logs\" to Biden's private home, with GOP Representative Lance Gooden of Texas writing the president a letter demanding the release of the logs.\n\n\"Today, we learned that Biden was keeping classified documents in the garage of his Delaware home,\" Gooden tweeted while sharing the letter. \"However, the Biden WH is still shielding the Visitor Logs from that home. The American people deserve to know who had access to that garage.\"\n\n\"Apparently now we know why they've been so secretive about the visitor logs at Joe Biden's home,\" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted in response to Gooden. \"Don't Americans deserve to know? If it was Trump they'd be clamoring for it!\"\n\n\"How many times did Hunter Biden visit Joe Biden's Wilmington home with the classified docs and the Corvette?\" tweeted conservative activist Charlie Kirk. \"Release the visitor logs!\"\n\nAs a private residence, it is not clear that any visitor logs would be kept at Biden's home in Delaware. Regardless of any records, the possibility that Hunter Biden visited his father's home at any point during the roughly six years since he was vice president seems far from remote.\n\nHowever, there is little reason to believe that Hunter Biden would have reviewed the documents during a visit with his father.\n\nEarlier this week, Donald Trump claimed without evidence that Chinese agents \"saw\" the classified documents that were stored at Penn Biden Center.\n\nThe status of any visitor logs taken at the residences of Trump, who is facing potential criminal indictments over his own classified documents scandal, is unclear.\n\nIn 2017, a watchdog group sued the then-president to release visitor logs from Mar-a-Lago, which is a private club in addition to being Trump's private residence. The Secret Service later said that the names of visitors could not be released because no such log existed.\n\nAs part of the same lawsuit, the Department of Homeland Security said that there were no visitor logs for Trump Tower in New York City, which was still serving as Trump's primary private residence at the time.\n\nTrump also refused to publicly release White House visitor logs during his presidency, prompting some to criticize his administration over a lack of transparency. The Biden White House publicly releases White House visitor logs online every month.\n\nDuring a press conference on Thursday, a Fox News reporter asked White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre when the Biden administration would \"release a log of visitors to the Wilmington house.\"\n\nJean-Pierre did not answer the question directly or indicate whether a log existed, while instead pointing out how current White House policy on its own visitor log differed from that of the Trump administration.\n\n\"We did something that the last White House got rid of,\" she said. \"Which is instituting the White House logs. Did you ask the last administration why they got rid of the White House logs?\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the White House for comment.",

In attendance was former Michigan Governor and current U.S. Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm.\n\nHarris said millions of dollars are going toward initiatives to helping reduce climate crisis impacts like the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\"You can look at, for example, the data that tells us that some of the regions in America with the poorest air quality are low-income communities and communities of color,\" she said.\n\nA big topic of discussion was electric cars and its impact on the economy. Harris mentioned her loved for not just electric cars, but electric school buses.\n\n\"What it might do to the child's ability to fully maximize their capacity to learn because of the health impacts and maybe decrease lost \n\ndays of school,\" she said.\n\nElectric vehicles are one of the focuses for the Biden-Administration's climate crisis initiatives and how to bring electric car manufacturers back to America.\n\n\"We, in-fact, are producing at record amounts ourselves and is producing natural gas at record amounts. We have the ability to do that at home and we also want the ability to produce energy for electricity so that means clean, solar, wind, hydro-electric power,\" Granholm said.",

            "description": "As a new report shows price pressures easing, should the central bank rethink its strategy of raising interest rates?",
            "content": "What a difference a year makes. This time twelve months ago, the cost of gasoline was soaring, the prices of many other items were rising sharply as well, and Republicans were gleefully trumpeting “Bidenflation.” Now things are moving firmly in the other direction. When the Consumer Price Index for December was released on Thursday morning, it showed the headline rate of inflation dipping to 6.5 per cent, from 7.1 per cent the previous month. Since peaking at 9.1 per cent in June, the rate has fallen for six months in a row. And other details from the C.P.I. report are even more encouraging.\n\nThe headline rate of inflation is an annual figure: it shows how much prices rose between December, 2021, and December, 2022. To gauge more recent trends, it is also useful to look at changes over one month or three months, although these numbers should be viewed cautiously. Thanks largely to a sharp drop in the cost of energy, including gasoline, over-all prices didn’t rise at all in the last month: they fell by 0.1 per cent. To be sure, that’s a small change, but it represented the first monthly decline in prices since April, 2020, near the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIf you look at the past three months, the attenuation in pricing pressures doesn’t look quite as striking, but it’s still evident. In the period from October to December, the annualized rate of inflation was about two per cent. As Joe Biden pointed out in an appearance at the White House, that’s compared with more than ten per cent in the first three months of last year.\n\nHowever you look at the figures, the over-all rate of inflation has come down appreciably as gas prices have fallen and pandemic-related problems with the global supply chain have eased. But what about “core” inflation, which strips out the prices of volatile items, such as food and energy, and which policymakers monitor closely? That metric also shows inflation declining from 6.6 per cent in September to 5.7 per cent in December. And, if you restrict your attention to the most recent three months, the fall in core inflation is quite dramatic—all the way down to 3.1 per cent on an annualized basis. “That is some seriously good news,” Julia Coronado, a former Federal Reserve economist who is president of the advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives, wrote on Twitter.\n\nSome other commentators were more guarded, but they, too, acknowledged the downward trend. “The latest datapoint closes the books on 2022 and signals that meaningful progress in the U.S. economy’s fight against elevated inflation was made in the closing months of the year,” Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement. Biden, while acknowledging that “we still have more work to do,” was perfectly justified in declaring, “the data is clear: Even though inflation is high in major economies around the world, it is coming down in America month after month.”\n\nActually, because of a quirk in the way that the government treats the costs of housing, inflation may well be decreasing faster than the C.P.I. report indicated. One of the less encouraging takeaways from the report is that the price of shelter, which includes rents and lodging away from home, increased by 0.8 per cent last month, and by seven per cent over the previous twelve months. Since housing costs make up about a third of the entire C.P.I., this jump had a big impact on the over-all figures, particularly for core inflation, which rose 0.3 per cent in December. Indeed, the report noted that the “shelter index was the dominant factor in the monthly increase in the index for all items less food and energy.”\n\nThe issue, one widely acknowledged among economists, is that the C.P.I.’s measure of housing costs lags behind what is happening in the actual housing market, where rising interest rates have put an end to the boom that emerged during the first two years of the pandemic. Even as the C.P.I. shows the costs of shelter still rising, private-sector measures show the opposite. The widely followed S. & P. CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index has been dropping since July. And, according to Zillow, asking rents across the country fell in both October and November. (Figures for December aren’t available yet.)\n\nThis wading through the weeds has two important implications. If the C.P.I. reflected private-sector estimates of rents, the official estimates of headline and core inflation would now be lower. And, as the C.P.I. catches up with the private-sector data, there will be further downward pressure on the official figures. “Rising rents have been one of the drivers of inflation, so a rapid reversal would be a big deal,” Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told me.\n\nWill all this be enough to persuade Jerome Powell and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve to rethink their inflation-fighting strategy—and to prevent the Fed-induced recession that many economists have predicted later this year? Having already signalled another interest-rate hike next month, Powell et al. will almost certainly follow through with it, lifting the federal funds rate by another quarter point, to above 4.5 per cent. But they now have a lot to consider. In 2020 and 2021, as inflation spiked, they arguably failed to react quickly enough. With price pressures now easing, they will need to guard against moving too slowly again. ♦",

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nLOS ANGELES, Jan 12 (Reuters) - As \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" climbs the box office charts, director James Cameron stuck his hands and feet in cement outside the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on Thursday to commemorate his contributions to the film business.\n\nLongtime collaborator Sigourney Weaver tricked Cameron and producer Jon Landau into going barefoot for the ceremony. Usually, honorees keep their shoes on.\n\n\"Avatar: The Way of Water\" is expected to pass $2 billion in ticket sales in the coming days, making it among the highest-grossing movies of all time, along with the original \"Avatar\" and Cameron's \"Titanic.\"\n\n\"The box office from our perspective allows us to continue. It's empowering,\" Cameron told Reuters. He has already filmed a third movie in the series.\n\n\"Writing and designing the subsequent two films, it's now going to pay off, so that's a good feeling,\" he added.\n\nReporting by Rollo Ross; Writing by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Chris Reese",

            "content": "CINCINNATI, Ohio - Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson hasn’t played in over a month, and he’s indicated that he won’t be playing anytime soon.\n\nJackson took to Twitter on Thursday night and tweeted out details about a knee injury he suffered against the Denver Broncos on Dec. 4. In his tweet, Jackson said that he suffered a PCL Grade 2 sprain on the borderline of a Grade 3 sprain.\n\nHe also added that there is inflammation around his knee and confirmed he won’t be playing this weekend by adding that saying, “I wish I could be out there with my guys more than anything, but I can’t give 100% of myself.”\n• None Tee Higgins says he’s ‘feeling great’ after missing Wednesday’s practice with an illness\n• None If Joe Burrow returns to the Super Bowl, he’ll join a small list of great quarterbacks who went back to back\n\nThis means that Jackson will miss his sixth straight game since he sustained that injury over a month ago. According to the Ravens’ injury report, Jackson did not practice at all this week and hasn’t practiced since getting hurt.\n\nThat means the sixth-seeded Ravens will have to turn to either Tyler Huntley or Anthony Brown Jr. when they head back to Cincinnati and rematch the three-seeded Bengals in Sunday night’s wild card playoff. Brown started against the Bengals last Sunday in the Ravens’ 27-16 loss. He threw for two interceptions, no touchdowns and 286 passing yards while completing less than 40% of his passes.\n\nHuntley is ahead of Brown on the depth chart but has fought through tendonitis in his right shoulder, causing him to miss last week’s game. He practiced Wednesday and Thursday but was a limited participant on Thursday and threw for the first time since Jan. 1.\n\nMohammad Ahmad covers the Bengals for cleveland.com.

            "description": "Captain Jared Spurgeon's 90 blocked shots is among the top 10 in the league.",
            "content": "ELMONT, N.Y. — Marc-Andre Fleury stopped a season-high 40 shots in his last start on Tuesday against the Rangers, but his workload could have been much higher.\n\nThe players in front of the Wild goaltender blocked a whopping 29 shots.\n\nThat captain Jared Spurgeon had five of them was unsurprising since no Wild skater in team history has more blocks than him.\n\n\"Maybe playing goalie for my brother at a young age helped a bit,\" Spurgeon said.\n\nAfter that five-block game vs. the Rangers, Spurgeon reached 90 on the season — far and away the most on the team and top 10 in the NHL.\n\nAdd those to the 1,282 the defenseman had coming into the season, and the franchise leader is closing in on 1,400, an impressive consistency despite the risks.\n\nNot only is there a chance the player blocking a shot ends up screening his own goaltender by impeding the netminder's ability to track the shot, but getting pinged with pucks — especially in close range — can lead to injury or an own goal.\n\n\"Ideally, we'd like to box out and let our goaltender see it,\" Wild coach Dean Evason said. \"But sometimes you get caught in that position where everybody's going to the net. So if you get caught in that spot — yeah, you need to block because there's people in behind you.\"\n\nChoosing whether to plug up a shooting lane or stay out of the way happens in a split second.\n\n\"I know it's difficult to make a decision when and when not to,\" Evason said. \"I know our commitment's there. As long as our commitment's there, guys are going to make some mistakes. But hopefully we'll block more than we'll screen.\"\n\nLike Kirill Kaprizov the previous week, Joel Eriksson Ek nearly scored on Tuesday after going for a shot between his legs.\n\nBoth players had their attempts hit the post.\n\nWhat makes the shot difficult for goaltenders is they can't read it, the puck sailing off the stick blade in a snapping motion without the usual wind-up that precedes shots when the puck is in front of a player.\n\n\"In a situation like [Eriksson Ek] had, he doesn't really have anything because if he's on his backhand, the goalie is already there covering everything,\" goalie Filip Gustavsson said. \"He has the backchecker on him so if he turns up and moves the puck back there, the guy's just going to put his stick on it. So, he kind of hides the puck from the defenseman, too, while pulling it between his legs like that.\"\n\nForward Sammy Walker and goaltender Jesper Wallstedt were named to the Central Division roster for the American Hockey League's All-Star Classic.\n\nWalker, who tallied his first NHL goal on Dec. 27 and has appeared in six games with the Wild, leads Iowa in goals with 14; the Edina native's 29 points are tied for first among AHL rookies.\n\nWallstedt is 8-7-3 with a 2.87 goals-against average and .906 save percentage in his first North American season since leaving Sweden after the Wild drafted him 20th overall in 2021. The goalie became the first in Iowa history to score a goal on Nov. 12.\n• The Wild placed forward Joseph Cramarossa on unconditional waivers to terminate his contract. Cramarossa split action between the Wild and Iowa since 2021, skating in four NHL games this season and chipping in a goal, but is going to play in Europe.",

            "description": "“Can you ask the comptroller to show you the letter he wrote to the federal government asking for help for us?” Adams fumed during a news conference at City Hall.",
            "content": "Mayor Eric Adams lashed out at state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli on Thursday after New York’s chief fiscal officer faulted him for not including the $1 billion-plus cost of the migrant crisis in his proposed city budget.\n\n“Can you ask the comptroller to show you the letter he wrote to the federal government asking for help for us?” Adams fumed during a news conference at City Hall.\n\n“Can you get him on his cell phone, speakerphone and say, ‘Can you send us the letter that you sent to the federal government saying: Help New York City? Or send us a tweet or do an Instagram post with a sign?'”\n\nThe exasperated mayor continued: “I mean, can you believe it? We’re the only ones that are saying, ‘Federal government, do your job.’ But everyone is telling us to do our job, which we are doing every day.”\n\nAdams also said that if DiNapoli “believes I’m not doing a good enough job, then I think he should be part of this team calling for the federal government to do their job.”\n\nHizzoner’s ire was sparked by a statement in which DiNapoli faulted Adams’ proposed $102.7 billion budget for fiscal 2024 because it doesn’t “reflect the anticipated recurring costs associated with asylum seekers, which remains one of a number risks the city will have to grapple with.”\n\n“The city must lay out these and other risks transparently so that it may continue to plan and identify new ways to close these gaps without harming services, which would be counterproductive to the city, and state’s, economic recovery,” DiNapoli added.\n\nIn addition to singling out DiNapoli, Adams appeared to take a shot at members of the city council, with whom held a virtual meeting before his news conference.\n\n“Where are their letters that they wrote to governmental entities to help New York City? Helpin’ New York City is not saying, ‘Spend more of taxpayers’ dollars,'” he said. “I just want one letter, one tweet — maybe y’all could find a tweet, did you see one?”\n\nAdams added: “So, I need help. And that was one of the No. 1 things I said to all my colleagues: I need you to join me in telling the federal government: New York taxpayers don’t deserve this.”\n\nSources familiar with that meeting told The Post that Adams repeatedly demanded that council members put heat on the White House and federal officials to provide more funding to the city.\n\n“He said, ‘I hear you all making demands about the migrants. I need you to reciprocate those demands to the federal government,'” one source said.\n\nAdams also told the council members that homeless shelters needed to be distributed more equitably throughout the city, another source said.\n\nAdams had repeatedly called for $1 billion in emergency federal aid to pay for the cost of housing and providing services to the nearly 40,000 migrants who’ve flooded into the Big Apple since the spring.\n\nBut the city has only received less than $8 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and another $2 million allocated by Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY), Budget Director Jacques Jiha told reporters during an afternoon briefing.\n\nLast week, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to commit to providing the city with the additional money when asked by The Post.\n\nInstead, she said only that the Department of Homeland Security will be “increasing funding available to border cities and those cities receiving an influx of migrants.”",

And that was one of the No. 1 things I said to all my colleagues: I need you to join me in telling the federal government: New York taxpayers don’t deserve this.”\n\n \n\nLast week, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to commit to providing the city with the additional money when asked by The Post.\n\nInstead, she said only that the Department of Homeland Security will be “increasing funding available to border cities and those cities receiving an influx of migrants.”",

            "title": "Bipartisan tech sector scrutiny grows",
            "description": "Senate Democrats and House Republicans will each use their majorities to examine the industry.",
            "content": "The new Republican House majority has the tech sector wondering not if there will be attempts to regulate the industry but how it might be done.\n\nThe stakes are high after Republicans took over the House majority on Jan. 3 following the 2022 midterm elections that left the party with a narrow 222-212 edge over Democrats. Lawmakers and regulators face shifting power dynamics and new political pressures to settle old disputes even as the companies under scrutiny struggle with sharp downturns and a churning marketplace.\n\nAs Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who is leading the bipartisan charge to get tough on tech, told NBC News, “it is time for 2023 — let it be our resolution that we finally pass one of these bills.”\n\nLast year, Congress got closer than ever to passing serious restrictions on how the digital giants of social media, commerce, entertainment, and the news media do business. December’s lame-duck session saw significant attention to antitrust rules, including last-minute attempts to add media regulations to “must-pass” legislation by bipartisan groups in the House and Senate.\n\nMembers of both parties entered an already raucous, harshly partisan 118th Congress with lots of tough talk about social media, news and information, free speech, and more. But the regulatory march isn’t limited to one branch — or one level — of government. The Supreme Court will soon hear arguments on suits challenging expansive powers Florida and Texas claimed with social media laws passed last year but that have not yet gone into effect.\n\nEven the nearly $70 million Big Tech spent lobbying in Washington against new regulations in 2021 starts to look small compared to the size of the regulatory beating it is facing this year. And the companies are doing so in an economic environment seeing consumers disappear after a long COVID-19-era boom for the digital world.\n\nCommerce and cloud giant Amazon announced continuing layoffs this month, bringing its total planned job cuts to 18,000. Cloud software competitor Salesforce says it will cut 10%, about 8,000 jobs, from its global workforce. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, lost more than a half-trillion dollars in market value over the course of 2022 and ended the year with 11,000 layoffs and a hiring freeze. Twitter’s turmoil has been front-page news for months.\n\nMany industries are downsizing in the face of losses or trimming their sails after forecasts for a slowing economy amid lingering fears of an inflation-driven recession. But those other industries aren’t the targets of intense scrutiny in Washington the way Big Tech is and has been for years.\n\nBoth parties took aim at tech firms when the industry flourished during the years of COVID-19 lockdowns when people went online for work, school, and commerce.\n\nRepublicans had been on the march against what they claimed was systematic bias against the Right by left-wing moderators at the companies. Restrictions on COVID-19 misinformation and political speech only intensified GOP anxieties.\n\nThere will be plenty of time to discuss that in the new House select committee on the \"weaponization of the federal government.\" Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) heads the panel, adding to his duties as the incoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nJordan was a crucial supporter of new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R) as the Californian took 15 ballots to nab the chamber’s top job early in the morning of Saturday, Jan. 7. Jordan, who split with most of the members of the Freedom Caucus he once chaired to back McCarthy, has already laid out an aggressive agenda. According to reports, Jordan’s plan includes probing communications between the Biden administration and tech companies for evidence of government pressure to censor right-wing and pro-Republican content online.\n\nThat has ginned up renewed interest among Republicans in scrutinizing the tech sector — though many GOP lawmakers already were paying attention after the release of the “Twitter Files,” reports based on documents provided by new Twitter owner Elon Musk on the company’s prior policies and conduct.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech sector’s record financial gains of recent years were drawing increased attention from the Democratic majority in the Senate and the Biden administration. President Joe Biden is likely looking to take a strong posture with populist appeals about the concentration of economic power and the push for unionization of tech firms, with his expected announcement of a campaign for a second term looming.\n\nThe expanded Democratic majority in the Senate is sure to consider expanding antitrust laws aimed at the core businesses of digital platforms. Klobuchar continues her bipartisan push. The Minnesota Democrat and 2020 presidential contender has two bills, one meant to forbid Amazon and others from giving preference to their own products on their own platforms and another that would force Apple to shed its users’ preference for privacy and security in favor of a less secure but more open approach like Google uses for its Play Store.\n\nNeither bill passed in prior sessions of Congress. But both garnered enough bipartisan support to ensure they’ll be reintroduced this congressional session, with a real chance one or both will be considered.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe news business, which has spent two decades in serious decline, is hoping to get a boost from Congress this year in a bid to force platforms like Facebook and Google to pay for content or maybe even be required to carry coverage. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act didn’t pass in the previous Congress, but it still has lots of supporters, especially for a provision that would allow news publishers to bargain collectively with websites that feature and link to news content. That may be a tougher case for news corporations to make if tech companies continue to struggle financially.\n\nTech companies haven’t had much experience playing the pauper in appeals for protection from new regulations, but as their sector continues to face turbulence, they may be looking for mercy. The question is whether members of both parties, still steamed over COVID-19-era controversies and in need of new successes against populists’ targets, will care.",

According to reports, Jordan’s plan includes probing communications between the Biden administration and tech companies for evidence of government pressure to censor right-wing and pro-Republican content online. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act didn’t pass in the previous Congress, but it still has lots of supporters, especially for a provision that would allow news publishers to bargain collectively with websites that feature and link to news content. That may be a tougher case for news corporations to make if tech companies continue to struggle financially.",

            "title": "Special Counsel Robert Hur Worked with Rod Rosenstein",
            "description": "Special Counsel Robert Hur was nominated by former President Donald Trump in 2018 to lead the Maryland U.S. attorney’s office.",
            "content": "Special Counsel Robert Hur, appointed Thursday by Attorney General Merrick Garland to probe President Joe Biden’s mishandling of classified information, was among those at the Justice Department who had knowledge about the Russia hoax perpetrated on former President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to a Justice Department document, Hur is a former DOJ official “who handled, participated in, or have personal knowledge of the FBI’s relationship and communications with” Christopher Steele, who authored the infamous dossier that paved the way for the Russia hoax.\n\nHur began his career by clerking for the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist after graduating from Harvard and Stanford. Hur was then hired as the principal associate deputy attorney general, “serving as the top aide to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general under President Donald Trump. Before that, he had also been special assistant to Christopher A. Wray, who was leading the Justice Department’s criminal division at the time and went on to become the FBI director,” according to the Washington Post.\n\nRosenstein announced Hur’s appointment in a press release, praising him as having “experience and judgment [that] will advance our efforts to deter crime, promote the rule of law, and ensure equal justice for everyone.”\n\nIn 2018, Trump nominated Hur to lead the Maryland U.S. attorney’s office. Hur was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in March of that year.\n\nUnder Hur’s direction at the Maryland U.S. attorney’s office, he “brought and resolved charges for corruption and/or fraud against dozens of elected officials, public office holders, and public employees,” according to the Justice Department’s press release.\n\nDuring Hur’s service, the Maryland U.S. attorney’s office was reportedly one of the busiest in the nation. Hur prosecuted a case of a former National Security Agency contractor who allegedly stole classified information from the federal government. The theft was reportedly the largest of classified documents in U.S. history.\n\nIn February 2021, Hur departed the U.S. attorney’s office and joined the global legal offices of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which handles white-collar criminal issues and regulatory matters. The law firm employs “1,800 lawyers in 20 offices in major cities throughout the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and South America,” its website states.\n\nHur’s appointment as a special prosecutor on Thursday comes as Republicans have slammed Biden’s double standard of justice. Two weeks after Biden’s classified documents were unearthed at the Penn Biden Center, Garland named a special counsel to investigate Trump, not Biden. Garland only appointed Hur after classified documents were found at Biden’s residence.\n\n“The double standard of the corrupt DOJ and FBI, which have been weaponized against Joe Biden’s political opponents, could not be more clear,” Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), the third highest ranking House Republican, told Breitbart News.\n\n“The American people are watching as classified documents are uncovered at Joe Biden’s ‘think tank’ and now in Joe Biden’s own garage, but they have yet to see the same action taken by these agencies that launched an unprecedented raid against President Donald Trump’s home,” she added.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) stated that “With or without a special counsel, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee will investigate President Biden’s mishandling of classified documents”\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), who barely won reelection in 2022, said she hopes the special counsel was not just created to cover up Biden’s wrongdoing. “Let’s hope this amounts to more than just a cover-up of the scandal.”\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter @WendellHusebø.

            "title": "Biden is in a hole of his own making",
            "description": "Right as he is hitting a nice stretch, the president has been tripped up by the — what else — issues around document retention.",
            "content": "Biden faces weeks, if not months, of legal probing, speculation and bad headlines over his handling of the material. Not to mention the very strong likelihood of additional House GOP probes into the matter. He also found himself deprived, for the time being, of a clean-shot talking point against his archnemesis former President Donald Trump — who is facing a separate special counsel investigation into his own handling of classified materials kept at his private club and home in Florida.\n\nThe two cases are markedly different. But some Democrats privately concede that their coexistence gives the president’s critics a chance to denounce him as negligent, hypocritical or careless right at a time when things were moving Biden’s way.\n\n“I think it takes the whole Trump scandal off the table,” said one Democratic Party operative, granted anonymity to speak freely about the delicate situation unfolding around the president.\n\n“Most polls show that voters don’t give a fuck about this stuff,” they added. “But the media momentum is real.”\n\nElected Democrats have largely rallied behind the president, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries telling reporters that he has “full faith and credit in President Biden” on the documents matter. Biden, Jeffries told reporters, “is doing everything to take appropriate steps and how to move forward in a responsible fashion.”\n\nBut Capitol Hill Democrats have called for briefings and more information surrounding the former vice president’s document storage. And some have started to privately worry that the ordeal will distract from their collective priorities and could begin to help validate GOP investigations they dismiss as politically motivated headaches.\n\nAt a minimum, there is a recognition that this would complicate the White House’s public efforts to create a contrast between their professional operations and “the House leadership circus,” as one Democratic official put it.\n\nAnother party elder conceded that it was frustrating to hand Republicans “a hammer.” But, like others, the person said it was still too early to conclude that the episode would have a lasting negative political impact.\n\n“Comparing this to what Trump did isn’t like comparing apples and oranges, it’s like comparing apples and arsenic,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whose messy leadership battle has been held up by Biden advisers and Democratic allies as Exhibit A of the GOP’s dysfunction, pledged congressional investigations into the Biden documents.\n\n“Here’s an individual that sat on ‘60 Minutes,’ that was so concerned about President Trump’s documents locked in behind him,” McCarthy said. “Now we find as the vice president he’s keeping it for years out in the open in different locations. I do not think any American believes that justice should not be equal to all.”\n\nWhile Democrats have dismissed pledges like McCarthy’s as typical political fare of the opposition party, they also have been frustrated with elements of how the White House has handled the situation. When news broke about the discovery of the first tranche of secret documents at the president’s private office, Biden, one of his lawyers and the White House press secretary reiterated that the president’s lawyers followed a process of informing government records-keepers and cooperating with Justice Department officials.\n\nBut nowhere in their remarks or written statement was there an acknowledgment that — as Garland revealed on Thursday — more classified papers had been found at the president’s Delaware home on Dec. 20. Nor have they explained why the discovery of the first tranche was not revealed when it happened on Nov. 2.\n\nThose questions became a flashpoint between the White House and its press corps, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre coming under fire on Thursday for failing to inform the public of the findings.\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden addressed the documents during a speech that had been pegged to improving the economy and lowering the inflation rate. Asked what he was thinking by keeping classified material next to his prized car, Biden noted that “my Corvette is in a locked garage, OK? So it’s not like they’re sitting out on the street.”\n\nThe hope among Biden allies is that, in the long run, the special counsel could be remembered as something of a boon for the president in that it removes the appearance of bias and, conceivably, makes it easier for the separate special counsel in Trump’s own case to move forward. Biden, the thinking goes, has the opportunity to fully clear his name — possibly at some point before he runs for reelection next year.\n\nBut in the short term, the politics could be punishing. The coverage puts Biden on Trump’s level — removing some of the high ground the president sought when he spoke this past fall about the sanctity of classified documents. Biden’s team, for its part, has declined opportunities to draw the contrast, leaving that to outside allies. But some of their remarks on the subject do so implicitly.\n\nIn a statement, a Biden lawyer pledged cooperation with the special counsel.\n\n“As the president said, he takes classified information and materials seriously,” Biden attorney Richard Sauber said, “and as we have said, we have cooperated from the moment we informed the Archives that a small number of documents were found, and we will continue to cooperate.”\n\nJonathan Lemire and Olivia Beavers contributed to this report.",

So it’s not like they’re sitting out on the street.”\n\nThe hope among Biden allies is that, in the long run, the special counsel could be remembered as something of a boon for the president in that it removes the appearance of bias and, conceivably, makes it easier for the separate special counsel in Trump’s own case to move forward.

            "content": "Chelsea suffered another injury blow on a disastrous night at Craven Cottage on Thursday.\n\nThe Blues saw midfielder Denis Zakaria limp off before the hour mark in a 2-1 defeat against west London rivals Fulham.\n\nThe German joins a lengthy injury list at Stamford Bridge to add to under-pressure manager Graham Potter's woes, with on-loan forward Joao Felix sent off for a poor sliding challenge on his debut too.\n\nOffering an update after the match, Potter said: 'The only assessment is it's at the top of the quad. He felt it when he cleared the ball. In terms of the extent, it's too early to say.'\n\nZakaria was able to walk off the pitch, clutching his thigh, but looked upset as he hobbled down the tunnel, indicating it could be a significant absence.\n\nThe 26-year-old, on loan from Juventus, had featured in Chelsea's last six matches and his absence will be a blow.\n\nLast week, the club suffered a triple injury blow as Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic went off in the first half against Manchester City, with Mason Mount ruled out before kick-off - although Mount recovered to play 80 minutes on Thursday.\n\nChelsea now have ten senior players injured, with Zakaria, Sterling and Pulisic joining defenders Reece James, Wesley Fofana and Ben Chilwell, goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, N'Golo Kante, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Armando Broja on the sidelines.\n\nPotter said after the City defeat: 'It never rains but it pours, as they say... Stability helps you improve. From the last game at Bournemouth, we lost James and Mount from the starting XI. That's the challenge that we've faced since we've been here.'",

            "content": "Joao Felix's red card against Fulham is set to cost Chelsea a huge £2.1million after he joined the Blues on Wednesday.\n\nFelix made his debut for Graham Potter's side in the west London derby on Thursday, with Fulham running out 2-1 winners.\n\nHowever, after initially impressing, his debut ended in catastrophic fashion as he was sent off for a reckless lunge on Cottagers defender Kenny Tete.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chelsea had confirmed the signing of the 23-year-old on a loan deal until the end of the season.\n\nHowever, in order to secure the talented forward, Chelsea agreed to pay a loan fee of £9m for the short-term deal - while they will also cover Felix's wages during his spell in west London - estimated to be worth £6m.\n\nThis works out as a cost of £15m to the Blues over the remaining 21 Premier League games, including Thursday's defeat to Fulham.\n\nAs a result, Chelsea will be paying £714,286 per game to have Felix as part of their squad as they aim to recover from a disastrous start to the season that has seen them languishing in mid table.\n\nFelix's dismissal for violent conduct means he will miss the Blues' Premier League games with Liverpool, Fulham and West Ham.\n\nIn total, as part of the loan deal, this three-game suspension for Felix will cost his new club £2,142,858.\n\nDespite his costly mistake on and off the pitch, which leaves the under-pressure Blues boss Potter with further selection headaches, the Englishman defended the Portuguese forward after the game.\n\n'It didn't feel like an emotional one. It was miscontrolled, and a football action that can happen with the speed of the Premier League. He didn't go to hurt anybody. He didn't lose his head.\n\n'They're all learning moments. Joao is a young player, top player, and you see his qualities. There was no malice in it at all but I understand why it was a red. It was a little bit high and the referee has decision to make.\n\n'It's really frustrating, incredibly challenging and I feel for the supporters. It is another blow the hits keep coming at the moment. He was really good you could see his quality in the game so to lose Joao for three matches is really disappointing.'\n\nThe defeat to their west London rivals leaves Chelsea in 10th place - 10 points off the top four - and having played a game more than Manchester United who sit in fourth.",

            "title": "Bears Hire Big Ten’s Warren, Another Step Toward A New Stadium",
            "description": "The Bears are hiring Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren to be their new team president and chief executive. Warren has worked for three NFL teams, and played a key role in helping the Vikings design and build US Bank Stadium. That experience could be valuable given the Bears' pursuit of a stadium.",
            "content": "The Chicago Bears have played 103 seasons but never owned their own stadium. It seems that is about to change, with the hiring of new president Kevin Warren the latest development in the process.\n\nIn Warren, the McCaskey family appears to have hired the executive who will play a leading role in designing a state-of-art complex in Arlington Heights, located in Chicago’s northwest suburbs.\n\nHe arrives with a resume that leads with his short tenure as commissioner of the Big Ten conference. But for Bears Chairman George McCaskey, the most significant part of Warren’s background is that the 59-year-old lawyer has worked for three NFL franchises.\n\nWarren, who began his career with the St. Louis Rams, worked for the Detroit Lions before joining the international law firm Greenberg Traurig. He represented the Wilf family and Minnesota Vikings ownership group in its purchase of the Vikings, then joined the team as executive vice president of legal affairs and chief administrative officer. He was named Chief Operating Officer in 2015, becoming the black COO in the NFL.\n\nWarren was heavily involved in the process that led to the opening of US Bank Stadium in 2016, in addition to the team’s adjacent headquarters and practice facility.\n\n\"Kevin is a man of integrity, respect and excellence, all of which are critical core values of the Chicago Bears, and we welcome his perspective and diverse thought to lead this storied organization,\" McCaskey said. \"He is a proven leader who has many times stepped outside of his comfort zone to challenge status quo for unconventional growth and prosperity. In this role, Warren will serve in the primary leadership position of the franchise to help bring the next Super Bowl championship trophy home to Bears fans.”\n\nWarren’s connection to the Bears was reported earlier this month. Ian Rapoport of NFL.com reported on Thursday the hire had been made, and the team announced it later in the day.\n\nWhile Warren will oversee the Bears’ entire operation, replacing the retiring Ted Phillips, he arrives at a time when the franchise is focused on building a stadium.\n\nThe Bears have acquired rights to the 326-acre lot where the Arlington Park horse track operated. The team secured a deal to purchase the lot from the Churchill Downs Corporation.\n\nThere are still some hurdles to clear before the team leaves Soldier Field, which has been its home since leaving Wrigley Field, which it shared with the Cubs. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently unveiled a plan that could add a dome onto the stadium that sits in the city’s museum campus, alongside Lake Michigan, but the Bears’ ownership group appears to prefer a fresh start on its own land.\n\nThe Arlington Park site benefits from having train access from the city and the suburbs, as well as parking and room for commercial development. The team’s lease with Soldier Field runs through 2033. The Chicago Tribune has reported that a provision in the lease would allow the Bears to leave the lakefront stadium in 2026, at a penalty of $84 million. That cost decreases in subsequent years.\n\nWhile the Bears have room to replicate the NFL’s newest stadiums, most notably SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., the Midwestern climate points to US Bank Stadium as at least as much of a model. The Vikings hosted Super Bowl XXLI.\n\nPhillips recommended Warren as his replacement. It remains to be seen how much influence Warren will have on the Bears’ roster and team-building strategies.\n\nPhillips’ influence was lessened when the Bears hired Ryan Poles to replaced Ryan Pace as general manager after the 2021 season. Poles reported directly to McCaskey, not Phillips, but Warren is clearly above Poles on the team’s chain of command.\n\nThis is a critical winter for the Bears, who not only hold the first pick in the draft but are positioned to add multiple high-impact veterans via free agency. Pace moved up in the 2021 draft to select quarterback Justin Fields, and it is left for Poles and head coach Matt Eberflus to decide if they are comfortable building around him or should attempt to upgrade with the first pick.",

            "summary": "But for Bears Chairman George McCaskey, the most significant part of Warren’s background is that the 59-year-old lawyer has worked for three NFL franchises. \n\nWarren was heavily involved in the process that led to the opening of US Bank Stadium in 2016, in addition to the team’s adjacent headquarters and practice facility. In this role, Warren will serve in the primary leadership position of the franchise to help bring the next Super Bowl championship trophy home to Bears fans.”\n\nWarren’s connection to the Bears was reported earlier this month. \n\nWhile the Bears have room to replicate the NFL’s newest stadiums, most notably SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., the Midwestern climate points to US Bank Stadium as at least as much of a model.",

            "title": "Goldman Sachs says Asia tech is about to rebound — and reveals a chip stock to play it",
            "description": "Investors seeking to cash in should act early, according to Goldman Sachs, which expects prices to rebound from the first half.",
            "content": "Tech stocks in Asia endured a difficult year in 2022, much like their peers in the U.S. and beyond, as they struggled with an inventory correction, supply chain disruptions and a global economic slowdown. But Goldman Sachs believes the region's tech sector is headed for a \"major bottom\" — and subsequent upturn — in the first half of 2023, which could open the door for investors to jump back into Asia tech stocks. \"We believe that ... major bottom and stock bottom-fishing will likely occur in 1H2023,\" Goldman's analysts, led by Daiki Takayama, wrote in a note on Jan 8. \"In addition to monitoring the timing of the recovery, if near-term earnings and share prices correct quickly, signs of an earnings bottom may be confirmed as early as the earnings reporting season at the end of January and first half of February, which could reinforce bottom-fishing sentiment. This is a positive scenario in our view,\" he added. Investors seeking to cash in should act early, according to Takayama, who said stock prices will \"rebound rapidly.\" TSMC among top picks One of Goldman's top picks is chip behemoth Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . \"We like TSMC as we believe its solid technology leadership and execution make it better positioned vs. peers to capture the industry's long-term structural growth, particularly in areas such as 5G, artificial intelligence, high performance computing, electric vehicles,\" the bank said. TSMC — a key Apple supplier — is arguably the world's most important semiconductor manufacturer . It has also been caught up in the middle of the U.S.-China tech battle over semiconductors, with the U.S seeking to cut China off from critical chips and tools while trying to re-shore semiconductor production. In December, TSMC announced the opening of a second chip plant in Arizona , upping its investment in the state from $12 billion to $40 billion. President Joe Biden and Apple CEO Tim Cook were both at the event where the investment was announced, underscoring the critical role TSMC plays in the American semiconductor sector. Goldman has a price target of 600 Taiwan dollars ($19.70) on the buy-rated stock, which represents potential upside of 23.7% to its Jan. 11 closing price. On Tuesday, the company recorded its first quarterly revenue miss in two years . Fourth-quarter revenue at TSMC rose 43% to 625.5 billion Taiwan dollars, which fell short of estimates, according to FactSet data. Nevertheless, TSMC remains an analyst favorite, with 90% of analysts covering the stock giving it a buy rating, according to FactSet. They give it average potential upside of 25%. — CNBC's Michael Bloom and Arjun Kharpal contributed to reporting",

            "description": "Former Speaker takes shot at ex-president in CNN interview",
            "content": "Former Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has hit out at former President Donald Trump as a “proven loser” in an interview on CNN.\n\n“He’s fading fast,” Mr Ryan said of Mr Trump to the network’s Jake Tapper. “He’s a proven loser. He cost us the House in ‘18, he cost us the White House in ‘20, he cost us the Senate again and again, and I think we all know that and I think we’re moving past Trump. I really think that’s the case. I can’t imagine him getting the nomination, frankly.”\n\nMr Ryan, who was Speaker of the House when Mr Trump entered the White House in 2017 and left politics entirely shortly thereafter, didn’t have such a sterling record of political success himself. He was Senator Mitt Romney’s running mate when Mr Romney lost the race to the White House to Barack Obama.\n\nSince leaving Congress four years ago, Mr Ryan has sat on corporate boards and surfaced in the media as an opponent of the Trump wing of the party. At the same time, he has been a booster of the same hardline neoliberal fiscal politics he espoused when he caught Mr Romney’s attention as a House member from Wisconsin at the beginning of the last decade.\n\nMr Ryan was on Tapper’s CNN show on Thursday to comment on his former colleague Kevin McCarthy’s painful ascension to the Speakership last week — a drama he claimed was a result of serious policy differences between Republicans and not any of the other issues like election denialism that appeared to unite the group of roughly 20 members who opposed Mr McCarthy.\n\n“Most of that wasn’t personal, most of that was around fiscal responsibility,” Mr Ryan said. “Most of that was about a concern about spending, inflation, and debt. That’s great. I think you need to persuade the country as to the solutions and the problem, and I don’t think brinksmanship solves those things, but what’s behind that is a good thing which is Republicans finally reacquiring their moorings on the party of fiscal responsibility and limited government.”\n\nMr Ryan’s politics of so-called fiscal responsibility have seemingly gone out of style in a Republican Party responsible for slashing taxes for the wealthy and inflating the federal deficit during Mr Trump’s term in office.\n\nMr Ryan also said on the show that embattled Rep George Santos of New York should resign, echoing the calls of an increasing number of Republicans struggling to justify Mr Santos’ lies about his background and other issues surrounding his campaign.",

I can’t imagine him getting the nomination, frankly.”\n\nMr Ryan, who was Speaker of the House when Mr Trump entered the White House in 2017 and left politics entirely shortly thereafter, didn’t have such a sterling record of political success himself. He was Senator Mitt Romney’s running mate when Mr Romney lost the race to the White House to Barack Obama.\n\nSince leaving Congress four years ago, Mr Ryan has sat on corporate boards and surfaced in the media as an opponent of the Trump wing of the party. \n\nMr Ryan was on Tapper’s CNN show on Thursday to comment on his former colleague Kevin McCarthy’s painful ascension to the Speakership last week — a drama he claimed was a result of serious policy differences between Republicans and not any of the other issues like election denialism that appeared to unite the group of roughly 20 members who opposed Mr McCarthy.\n\n“Most of that wasn’t personal, most of that was around fiscal responsibility,” Mr Ryan said. “Most of that was about a concern about spending, inflation, and debt.",

            "content": "Sofia Ritchie flaunted her flat midriff and sculpted physique for a Pilates class in Los Angeles on Thursday.\n\nThe 24-year-old socialite – who debuted her gorgeous new hairstyle last month – rocked a dark green crop top with a matching pair of skintight leggings.\n\nRichie's Pilates look is the latest example of her chic and effortless aesthetic as the young fashionista nails her street style ever time she steps out in Los Angeles.\n\nWith her blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail, the influencer glowed as she emerged from the Pilates studio.\n\nSofia sported green designer shades and carried a brown leather bag for her outing, stepping up her athleisure look with luxurious accessories.\n\nBut Lionel Richie's daughter kept it cool and casual by tying a gray puffer around her slender waist.\n\nThe model wore minimal makeup and allowed her radiant complexion to shine.\n\nThis latest sighting comes on the heels of Sofia enjoying a night out on Wednesday with her fiancé Elliot Grainge, 29.\n\nThe young couple oozed style and romance as they socialized at celeb hotspot Delilah.\n\nAlthough the pair keep their relationship relatively private, the social media personality and Grainge went Instagram official in April 2021.\n\nA year later, Sofia announced her engagement to the music executive in April 2022.\n\nThe engagement was a surprise to some fans, but the couple reportedly knew each other for years before they started dating.\n\nAccording to People, Sofia's father Lionel – who has been dating model Lisa Parigi, who is 40 years his junior, since 2014 – was a frequent collaborator and friend of Elliot's father, Sir Lucian Grainge.\n\nNearly a week after their engagement announcement, Lionel told Access Hollywood that Elliot was a 'nervous wreck' when asking for permission to marry Sofia.\n\n'I love Elliot,' said the music legend. 'I've known him since he was 12... It was one of those things where I don't have to go back and check out the kid. I know who it is.'\n\nPreviously, Sofia dated Scott Disick, 39 — reality star and father of Kourtney Kardashian's children — from 2017 to 2020.",

            "description": "Lisa Marie Presley appeared unsteady Tuesday during a TV interview before the Golden Globes ceremony.",
            "content": "Lisa Marie Presley appeared unsteady Tuesday during a TV interview before the Golden Globes ceremony.\n\nPresley, 54, is in the hospital and reportedly in critical condition after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nThe daughter of Elvis and Priscilla Presley is in an induced coma and on life support with a temporary pacemaker, according to TMZ.\n\nPresley can be seen leaning on her friend, 80-year-old talent manager Jerry Schilling, for support Tuesday during a red carpet interview with Extra TV.\n\nAs she was talking in the clip, she linked arms with Schilling, telling him, “I’m gonna grab your arm.” She went on to discuss the weather in California and Austin Butler’s role in “Elvis” with “Extra” host Billy Bush.\n\nPresley attended the awards show in support of the 2022 film, which chronicled the life of her father, rock n’ roll icon Elvis Presley.\n\nA TikTok video shared Wednesday showed her walking with Butler, at times shuffling and stumbling and seeming to need support.\n\nDuring the interview, Presley compared Butler to her late father, telling Extra, “‘It’s kind of done in sort of a funny, joking way, the way [Elvis] spoke, but Austin actually got it and did it perfectly without making it comical.”\n\nSgt. Sean Maloney of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Office told The Post that deputies responded to a call at the 5900 block of Normandy Drive in Calabasas at about 10:40 a.m. Thursday at the request of Los Angeles County Fire Department. The call involved a female in cardiac arrest.\n\nFire personnel were able to get a pulse and she was transported to West Hills Hospital, according to Maloney.\n\nPresley’s mother, Priscilla Presley, arrived to the hospital to be by her daughter’s side.\n\nPresley’s son, Benjamin Keough, died by suicide at the age of 27 in July 2020. Presley reflected on his death in an August essay that was published by People.\n\n“I already battle with and beat myself up tirelessly and chronically, blaming myself every single day and that’s hard enough to now live with, but others will judge and blame you too, even secretly or behind your back which is even more cruel and painful on top of everything else,” Presley wrote at the time.",

Sean Maloney of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Office told The Post that deputies responded to a call at the 5900 block of Normandy Drive in Calabasas at about 10:40 a.m. Thursday at the request of Los Angeles County Fire Department. \n\nPresley’s mother, Priscilla Presley, arrived to the hospital to be by her daughter’s side.",

            "description": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB Tom Brady has played the Dallas Cowboys seven times during his storied 23-year NFL career and defeated them in all seven games.",
            "content": "The Dallas Cowboys clinched the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and will play Tom Brady and the Buccaneers in the wild-card round Monday night.\n\nBrady's seven Super Bowl wins are well documented, and he's racked up an unprecedented 35 postseason victories.\n\nBut the future Hall of Fame quarterback has also won all seven of his regular-season games against the Cowboys.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nBrady holds numerous NFL postseason records, including most career completions and attempts, but none of that seems to matter to Cowboys players.\n\n\"No, not at all. It's about this next challenge. And, you know, going up against him and making sure we put as much pressure as possible on him, and we come out with the win,\" Lawrence said.\n\nSafety Jayron Kearse also chimed in, saying, \"It's 2023. He ain't beat us this year. That's all we're worried about.\"\n\nTOM BRADY ADDS MORE NFL RECORDS TO RESUME ON ONE PLAY VS. FALCONS\n\nBrady has thrown for 1,945 yards, 15 touchdowns and five interceptions against the Cowboys.\n\nBrady is also undefeated against the Vikings (6-0); his current team, the Buccaneers; and his former team, the New England Patriots.\n\nHe was undefeated against the Falcons until the Bucs lost to Atlanta in Week 18. Tampa Bay had already won the NFC South division entering the regular season finale with the Falcons, and Brady and many of the Buccaneers' starters did not play in the second half of the game.\n\nTOM BRADY RUMORS: DOLPHINS MENTIONED AS POSSIBLE LANDING SPOT AGAIN FOR STAR QB IN 2023 OFFSEASON\n\nIn Brady's most recent matchup against the Cowboys in September, the Bucs prevailed 19-3.\n\nTampa Bay had a turbulent 2022 season and finished with an 8-9 record, the first time Brady had a losing record in his career as a starter. Every team in the NFC South finished the season with a sub-.500 record.\n\nThe Buccaneers were able to capitalize on the weak division and went 4-2 against divisional opponents despite being one of the worst rushing teams in the NFL.\n\nBrady threw for over 4,600 yards, 25 touchdowns and nine interceptions on the year. He led the league with 490 completions and 733 pass attempts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlthough the Cowboys are odds-on favorites in the Monday night matchup with the Buccaneers, history certainly is not on Dallas' side.",

            "description": "Former foreign minister Julie Bishop has clapped back at her critics after she was accused of using Instagram filters to make herself look younger in photos",
            "content": "Former foreign minister Julie Bishop has clapped back at her critics after she was accused of using Instagram filters to make herself look younger in photos.\n\nThe glamorous politician, 66, addressed her trolls head-on in a video shared to Instagram on Wednesday after finishing her daily morning run.\n\nClad in head-to-toe activewear, Bishop said to the camera: 'Finished my run, [I'm] in the office, and apparently someone's complained about me using filter on posts.'\n\nAs she then approached the camera, the famous Snapchat dog filter appeared over her face, and she added nonchalantly: 'Personally, I don't get it.'\n\nShe used the hashtag #Filtergate in her caption.\n\nBishop's friends and fans offered words of support in the comments section.\n\n'They are just jealous, Julie... with or without a filter, it's your choice what you do,' one person wrote.\n\n'You don't owe an explanation to anyone.'\n\n'I think those people need a filter on their mouth. You keep shining,' another commented.\n\nBishop swatted away critics on Monday who accused her of using a filter to blur and soften her features in a video posted to Instagram.\n\nWhen an anonymous commenter from a private account wrote 'take the filter off though', the former long-serving Liberal deputy leader immediately shot back.\n\n'May I see your posts?' Bishop replied.\n\nMs Bishop previously batted back an accusation she was using a filter with a denial.\n\n'Are you using a filter,' a commenter asked, to which Bishop replied that if she was, 'I'd get rid of the mascara dripping under my eyes'.\n\n'You look so great I didn't even notice the mascara,' the questioner replied with a laughing emoji.\n\n'Rats! Shouldn’t have mentioned it,' Ms Bishop said.\n\nThe overwhelming response to Ms Bishop's post was positive, however.\n\n'Keep up the posts, don't worry about what others think,' one fan wrote on her feed.\n\nIn a subsequent post, Bishop uploaded a video that appeared to be in sharper focus than the preceding one, with her features less rounded and more lines apparent.\n\nThe fit former MP told the camera she was running '100 steps up, 100 steps down, the DNA Tower, double-helix lookout in Perth's Kings Park.\n\nIn her caption, Bishop said climbing the DNA-strand themed tower 'seemed appropriate for my run this morning - the blueprint of life'.\n\n'What a brilliant way to start the day,' she said in the video.\n\nIn December, Bishop attracted headlines after showing off her yoga skills with a headstand on Cottesloe Beach in the background of a live cross, surprising a Studio 10 reporter.\n\n'I was relatively fit but I was challenged by many of the poses,' she previously told Body + Soul.\n\n'Over time, I came to enjoy the experience and yoga has become part of my life.'\n\nBishop, who now runs a consulting business, Julie Bishop and Partners, has said she does yoga 'a few times a week'.\n\nJulie's eight-year romance with property developer David Panton ended over dinner in Sydney in July - just a week after the couple visited London together and dined with King Charles.\n\nThe couple went to dinner in Sydney's CBD where Mr Panton told a shocked Bishop their relationship had run its course.\n\nJulie is rumoured to now be dating fitness enthusiast Luke Hepworth after the pair were spotted arm-in-arm at several red carpet events late last year.",

            "description": "Miley Cyrus is back with a new single, 'Flowers,' from her upcoming eighth studio album 'Endless Summer Vacation.'",
            "content": "Miley Cyrus came into 2023 ready to hit the ground running. After hosting her second-annual New Year’s Eve party, Cyrus announced that a new single, titled “Flowers,” was on the way in January. Last week, Cyrus announced the release date of her eighth studio album, Endless Summer Vacation, described by the singer in a statement as “a love letter to LA.”\n\nThe sun and fun of Los Angeles is at the center of the video for “Flowers,” released today. “I can buy myself flowers / Write my name in the sand / Talk to myself for hours / See things you don't understand,” Cyrus sings against the backdrop of the City of Angels. “I can take myself dancing / And I can hold my own hand / Yeah, I can love me better than you can.” Throughout the video, Cyrus enjoys a self-care day at home as she goes for a swim in the pool, sweats through an outdoor workout, and cools off with a refreshing shower. As night falls, she dons a black power suit and dances around the house alone, acting as her own dance partner as well as her own entertainment.\n\nIndependence and self-reliance appear to be a key component of “Flowers,” and the carefree spirit of Endless Summer Vacation as a whole. Take the release date announcement, which fans noted coincided with the birthday of her ex-husband Liam Hemsworth. And while Miley’s summer vacation is sure to be filled with laughs, she likely won’t shy away from serious emotions either.\n\n“We met each other on the neon dinghy, past the manta rays and palm trees,” Cyrus says in the album trailer. “Glowing creatures beamed down from great heights. Electric eels and red venom. In the sky, we could see the riders on horseback. On comets. Coming toward us, kicking up with laughter.”",

            "description": "Westwood's head coach of eight seasons will retire on his best year.",
            "content": "“He did it the ‘Hard’ way.”\n\nThat’s how Westwood athletic director Dan Vivino will remember Dennis Hard, who announced his retirement after eight seasons as head coach of the Cardinals.\n\nThe 65-year-old, 43-year North Jersey coach served as defensive coordinator under Vito Campanile during the program’s back-to-back sectional titles in 2013 and 2014. He earned the job after Campanile’s departure for Seton Hall Prep and now he’s retiring on a record of 56-23 and a championship of his own.\n\nThe Cardinals defeated Rutherford 21-20 in the North 1, Group 2 final via a two-point conversion stand with no time remaining. It’s as storybook as it gets, but it’s not the idea of ending it at the summit that has Hard choosing now to call it quits.\n\n“When you know it’s time to go, it’s time to go,” he said.\n\nThe Westwood-Rutherford final was a battle of unbeatens and a matchup that essentially came down to the Bulldogs’ high-powered offense against the Cardinals’ elite defense, which had allowed just 30 points on the entire year.\n\nThey bent, but didn’t break at the goal line in as fitting a conclusion to their run to the sectional championship as possible.\n\n“It was a rollercoaster,” Hard said. “We felt like we were in a good spot with a few minutes left and then the next thing you know is they’re in the end zone. We jumped offsides and gave them the ball at the 1, but I still didn’t feel the need to panic. I knew some way we would win that game. The kids worked too hard that day to come away with anything but a victory.”\n\nThe Cardinals went on to lose 13-7 the following week to the eventual Group 2 champions in Caldwell, bringing their season to an end at 11-1.\n\nWhere does this team stack up with the best Westwood squads?\n\n“It’s right up there as one of the top,” he said. “We had a talented group. It was the right combination because it’s not like it was a senior class leaving and not coming back. They should be well-represented next year too.”\n\nHard racked up 52 wins in the head coaching chair at Wallington and Weehawken prior to his run at Westwood. Assistant coaching roles at Bergen Tech, Paramus Catholic, Wallington and Wayne Valley along with the wrestling head coaching job at River Dell made up the rest of his stops around North Jersey.\n\nBobby Guy, Westwood’s offensive coordinator, is the name expected to replace him. Making sure the program was in good hands was a huge priority for Hard, because Campanile did the same for him in 2015.\n\n“That was one of the things I talked about with Danny [Vivino],” he said. “Keeping the status quo was important because I didn’t want it to be different for the kids. They’ll have the same staff and everything. It will all be in place.”\n\nCampanile is still great friends with Hard and can recite a laundry list of stories that make him chuckle.\n\nHis brilliant defensive mind and old-school mentality made it a joy to coach alongside him for the now Bergen Catholic two-time state champion head coach.\n\n“The one time I told Dennis what to call it costed us 56 yards in a game at Mahwah,” Campanile laughed and said. “The defensive culture he generated made him a great guy to coach with. He’s about as loyal of a person as I’ve been around. He was the constant team person – he was never about himself. There was no flash with him, just grit. There aren’t a lot of coaches like him left. He’s always going to say how he feels and he’s a tough guy through and through.”\n\nVivino, who served on the staff with Campanile and Hard, echoed more of the same sentiment.\n\n“One of the things I remember was people saying how are you going to replace Vito,” he said. “Dennis didn’t try to replace Vito. Dennis tried to be Dennis. ‘Embrace the legacy’ was our slogan and he had a ton to live up to. He embraced the great culture the program we have and he worked with a coordinator on each side of the ball. He was never worried about being in control – he wanted to win together.”\n\nHard has a trip to Europe planned for March and he envisions himself making many visits to the Jersey Shore with his wife, Bernadette.\n\nWhen he looks back on his career, it’s the relationships that will come to mind first.\n\n“I enjoyed having such a big impact on the kids and the overall coaching experience,” he said. “I enjoyed the overall aspect of the game and the camaraderie of working with the other coaches. It didn’t feel like work.”\n\nThe N.J. High School Sports newsletter is now appearing in mailboxes 5 days a week.

            "content": "CALIFORNIA DREAMING — Look no further than California to see how pivotal 2024 is shaping up to be for the Democratic Party’s progressive wing.\n\nNationally, the Senate landscape could hardly be bleaker for Democrats — forced to defend roughly two-thirds of the seats up for election. That’s the reality for Democrats regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum.\n\nBut for the party’s left flank, Rep. Barbara Lee’s signal this week that she will run for Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat in California — on the heels of Rep. Katie Porter’s announcement she is running — laid bare the especially high stakes for progressives.\n\nFollowing John Fetterman’s recent victory in Pennsylvania’s Senate race and Sen. Raphael Warnock’s win in the Georgia runoff, progressives are confronting a test of whether they can replicate those big-state victories and grow their ranks in statewide office. And perhaps nowhere will be more revealing next year than California and its Senate race.\n\nAlready, the burgeoning field includes Lee, the longtime war critic and former leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, along with Porter, an ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The end result of such a contest in solidly blue California could mean a progressive— one of them, or someone else — replacing a centrist Democrat who has infuriated the left for years.\n\nWhile the overall Senate map “is going to be challenging,” Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the Bernie Sanders-aligned group Our Revolution, told Nightly, “places like California present an opportunity to grow a progressive voting bloc in the Senate, just like we’ve worked to build on the House side.”\n\nReferring to the Senate’s existing progressive champions, he said, “We’ve got to send in reinforcements — the Bernies and the Warrens have been kind of lone voices for so long.”\n\nThere are other states with Senate races where progressives will be tested in 2024. In Michigan, Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow said last week that she will not seek reelection. In Arizona, the left may field an alternative to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, after she switched her party affiliation from Democratic to independent. In increasingly Republican Ohio, the left has Sen. Sherrod Brown to defend.\n\nBut all those states are competitive, which is a different degree of difficulty than California, where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1 and Feinstein’s replacement is almost guaranteed to be a Democrat. The only question is what kind.\n\n“California will be an interesting test, because it should be the purest case study,” said Doug Herman, a Southern California-based Democratic strategist. “Everything else — those are purple states.”\n\nFor progressives, just being rid of Feinstein will be a victory.\n\nThe veteran senator said Tuesday she will announce her plans for 2024 “at the appropriate time,” but nobody expects Feinstein, the oldest sitting senator at 89, to seek another term. And nobody is celebrating that more than the progressive left. The California Democratic Party in the 2018 primary declined to endorse the centrist senator’s re-election bid — and that long before concerns about her cognitive fitness were aired last year.\n\nIn California, said Norman Solomon, a Californian and co-founder of the online activist group RootsAction.org, “more than in most states, progressives have real electoral clout.” Bernie Sanders carried the state in the 2020 presidential primary.\n\nBut progressives in 2024 may still have a problem in California, with its top-two primary system and regional divisions between the northern and southern parts of the state.\n\nFirst, the race could become a more “geographical battle” than an ideological one, Herman said, “if there’s one strong Northern California candidate and two Southern California candidates, or two up there, one down here.”\n\nAnd even if the candidate field does wind up geographically balanced, progressives may still have to contend with the danger of splitting the vote. Porter is definitely in. Lee told fellow lawmakers she is. But Rep. Ro Khanna, another progressive favorite, is a potential contender, as well. So are a raft of other Democrats, including Rep. Adam Schiff.\n\nProgressives, Geevarghese said, “have to be smart about not splitting the vote.” The challenge in California, he said, will be to avoid “a circular firing squad.”\n\nWelcome to POLITICO Nightly.

During an appearance today in Manhattan Supreme Court, Bannon’s attorneys said they no longer communicate directly with their client due to “irreconcilable differences” over how to approach the case. Bannon has reached out to at least seven law firms in the past several weeks to find new representation, according to his current counsel.\n\n— Garland appoints special counsel to review Biden documents: Attorney General Merrick Garland said he is appointing a special counsel — former U.S. Attorney Robert Hur — to review the storage of sensitive documents discovered in spaces used by President Joe Biden during the years preceding his return to the White House. Garland’s decision underscores the gravity of the discoveries, which included one set of documents found at an office space Biden used and another set found in the garage of his Wilmington home. The Justice Department had already appointed special counsel Jack Smith to look into former President Donald Trump’s handling and storage of classified material at his home in Mar-a-Lago.\n\n— Ex-governor tapped to fill Nebraska’s open Senate seat: Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen has appointed Pete Ricketts, the state’s former GOP governor, to fill retired Sen. Ben Sasse’s seat through 2024. Ricketts, who served two terms and endorsed Pillen in the race to replace him last year, will run in a special election next fall to fill out the remaining two years of Sasse’s Senate term. Ricketts said today that he is committed to running for the seat in both 2024 and 2026.\n\n— House Republicans plan crypto panel in first move to oversee troubled industry: House Republicans will establish a new subcommittee dedicated to cryptocurrency this Congress, a move that puts oversight and legislation around the ailing industry high on the GOP agenda. Incoming Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who has long made a priority of financial technology issues, said in an interview today that he plans to create the panel because he believes there is “a big hole in how we structure the committee” as it spends more time grappling with crypto topics.\n\n\n\nDIESEL CRUNCH — European countries imported unprecedented quantities of diesel fuel in December as buyers rush to secure supplies ahead of an EU ban on Russian oil products, writes Charlie Cooper.\n\nAccording to analysis by the Refinitiv market data firm, shared with POLITICO, diesel imports to the European region soared to a record 8.2 million tons in December.\n\nBefore the war in Ukraine, Russia typically supplied more than half of the EU’s imports and around 10 percent of its total demand for diesel — a vital fuel for road vehicles, trains and shipping as well as industrial and agricultural machinery. Imports of all Russian petroleum products, including diesel, will be banned by the EU from February 5 in one of the toughest sanctions yet against Moscow, aimed at squeezing the fossil revenues Vladimir Putin uses to finance his war against Ukraine.\n\nThe ban had prompted fears of a diesel supply crunch in the EU in the dead of winter, at a time when consumers are already suffering from high inflation and industries are feeling the burden of sky-high energy prices. But the recent glut of imports will likely mean any problems will not be felt in the immediate aftermath of the diesel ban.\n\nRajendran, a lead analyst at Refinitiv, part of the London Stock Exchange Group said “Europe has bought huge amounts of diesel to build up inventories as a safety net which is providing some reassurance to get through this winter. Current warmer weather is also reducing heating oil demand.”\n\n\n\nDUNGEONS & PRIVATE OWNERSHIP — The owners of the iconic fantasy-themed role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons are poised to abandon their power-to-the-players open licensing in a move that sparked uproar in the D&D community. The change could put dozens of small and independent publishers in legal jeopardy if they continue to rely on the d20 role-playing game system (the most basic setup for the game), which gives the company Wizards of the Coast the ability to siphon off portions of publishers’ revenue. The controversial decision has underscored the ramifications of private licensing over cultural phenomena. Read Matt Ford’s deep dive for The New Republic into how devotees of the legendary game could be on the losing side of an intellectual property war.\n\n\n\nSTARE DOWN — The White House is not panicking about a coming debt ceiling showdown — yet, write Jonathan Lemire, Caitlin Emma and Adam Cancryn.\n\nThe tumult surrounding Kevin McCarthy’s election to House speaker, and the rules changes that have empowered members of the far right, have previewed a number of potential showdowns.\n\nBut none promise to be as high stakes as the one over the debt ceiling. As the chaos unfolded last week, there was a growing sense of wariness and uncertainty over just how close the nation may come to fiscal calamity.\n\nThat has pushed the White House, months before the nation could hit its borrowing limit this summer, to begin laying the groundwork for negotiations.\n\nSenior White House officials and aides from the Office of Legislative Affairs have already fanned out across the Hill, introducing themselves to freshman lawmakers and staff and zeroing in on moderate Republicans whom they imagine might be getable in a debt ceiling vote, according to several people familiar with the strategy. Many of their prime targets are Republicans who won in districts that Biden carried in 2020 and those whose rhetoric and voting record suggest they could be persuaded to steer clear of the fiscal cliff.\n\nThe West Wing will later woo those lawmakers by giving them audiences with the president on Air Force One, Kennedy Center seats and visits to the White House as Biden and his aides press their case.\n\nThe concessions McCarthy made to become speaker in order to appease some of the hardliners in his caucus stripped him of some power he may need to keep the party in line. And his deal with conservatives stipulates that Republicans won’t support a debt limit increase if Congress doesn’t enact steep discretionary spending cuts or pass significant fiscal reforms to rein in the federal debt.\n\nTobin Marcus, who was an economic adviser to Biden when he was vice president during the 2011 debt ceiling standoff, said he expects the president and his top advisers to draw red lines against any entitlement cuts — but to otherwise hold off on dictating the parameters of a deal in hopes of finding a bipartisan resolution that can avert any economic fallout.\n\n“A lot of his inner circle now bear the scars of those confrontations in 2011 and 2013,” said Marcus, now a senior U.S. policy and politics strategist for investment bank Evercore ISI. “They’re going to want to not loudly slam the door on any kind of negotiation, while still keeping a quite firm line against negotiation on entitlements — and that’s going to be a tricky needle to thread.”\n\nDid someone forward this email to you?

            "content": "Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem received a letter Thursday from the National Park Service rejecting her request for Independence Day fireworks at Mount Rushmore.\n\nThe Daily Caller first obtained the letter, which was sent by Michell Wheatley to Wanda Goodman, who works for the Governor at the South Dakota Department of Tourism. In the letter, Wheatley mentions that local tribes view the fireworks as an “adverse effect” on their traditional cultural views.\n\n“Fireworks continue to be viewed by multiple Tribes as an adverse effect on the traditional cultural landscape,” Wheatley wrote in the letter. “This view was expressed by consulting Tribes in 2020 and has been reaffirmed by Tribal government representatives in subsequent meetings and letters.”\n\nIn 2021, Noem sent letters to three members of Congress from her state urging them for their assistance in making sure the fireworks display at Mount Rushmore does not get canceled under President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nThen, the Caller obtained three letters to the Republican lawmakers from South Dakota, including, Sen. John Thune, Sen. Mike Rounds, and Rep. Dusty Johnson, in which Noem explains the importance of the fireworks display and also details the economic benefits of having the firework display at Mount Rushmore.\n\nNoem told the Caller that she was worried about the display being canceled, as they were under former President Barack Obama’s administration, saying she could use the help of Republican members of Congress from the state to make sure they are not canceled again. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Gov. Kristi Noem Sends Letters To Members Of Congress Urging Against Canceling Mount Rushmore Fireworks Celebrations)\n\n“The Mount Rushmore Fireworks Celebration is the best way that we can celebrate America’s birthday. We lost our ability to hold this celebration during the Obama administration, so I’m asking our South Dakota delegation to help us advocate for this tremendous event,” Noem told the Daily Caller.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump helped bring back the fireworks celebration after they were banned in 2009 because of wildfire and pollution risks, NPR reported.",

            "content": "CLEVELAND (AP) — Back as a World Series title contender, the Cleveland Guardians are moving forward with upgrades to Progressive Field.\n\nThe team revealed on Thursday delayed final plans for a “reimagining” of its downtown home, which has aged well since opening in 1994 but is now the 11th oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball.\n\nThe Guardians have earmarked more than $200 million to remodel the upper deck, clubhouses and other areas over the next three years. The funds are part of an overall $435 million renovation project included in a new lease agreement the team signed last year through 2036.\n\nThe renovations will be done in stages and the Guardians intend to have them done by the 2025 season opener.\n\nThe ballpark’s new look will not include a sportsbook or space devoted for gambling, which became legal in Ohio on Jan. 1. The Guardians’ next-door neighbors, the Cleveland Cavaliers, opened a sportsbook inside Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse last week.\n\nMLB rules currently prohibit gambling spaces within the confines of a team’s ballpark.\n\n“We’re in the process of working through what a retail sports (gaming) option might look like here at Progressive Field as we speak,” said Brian Barren, the club’s president of business operations.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Guardians announced a multi-year partenership with bet365 to be the team’s exclusive mobile sports betting partner, but Barren said the timing was just a coincidence with the renovations being announced.\n\nAfter a name change before last season, the Guardians went 92-70 in 2022, ran away with the AL Central and pushed the New York Yankees to five games in the Division Series before being eliminated — with the majors’ youngest team.\n\nWhile there have been substantial renovations in the past at the ballpark, most recently before the 2016 season, the clubhouses have not been touched since they opened 28 years ago.\n\nChris Antonetti, the Guardians president of baseball operations, said the clubhouse refurbishment to training areas, kitchen facilities and other elements is long overdue and will allow the team to compete at the highest level\n\n“I’m hopeful that when our players and staff walk into the new facility they will feel excited and energized about the additional resources they have to help fuel their success as individuals and as a team,” he said.\n\nAntonetti said the Guardians decided not to switch the home dugout from the third- to first-base side after considering the move.\n\nBased on favorable feedback the team received after its most recent remodel, the Guardians will create more social spaces inside the ballpark to cater to fans looking for an experience beyond watching the game.",

            "content": "Former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that he believes he “had too much power” when he wielded the gavel.\n\n“I think I had too much power as speaker,” Ryan told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead,” adding that what bothered him “most” were omnibus bills – massive spending packages that are put to a single vote rather than individual appropriations measures voted on separately.\n\n“The problem is, no four people should be doing all of that, making those decisions,” Ryan added, referring to House leadership at the time. “I was making decisions on composition of spending bills.”\n\nHouse Republicans on Monday passed a rules package for the 118th Congress, in what marked the first test of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s ability to navigate his slim GOP majority. In it, McCarthy made a number of concessions in order to gain the support of conservative holdouts, including lowering the threshold needed to trigger a vote to oust a speaker.\n\nRyan, though, warned against some members potentially looking to take advantage of that concession, recalling advice former House Speaker John Boehner gave him upon winning the gavel in 2015.\n\n“The last thing John Boehner – the last words John Boehner said to me as he walked out of the room of his smoke filled office that I took over – don’t forget your number one job is to preserve the institution, defend the institution,” Ryan said.\n\n“I never really thought most members don’t think about the institution,” he added.\n\nWeighing in on the current state of the Republican Party, Ryan on Thursday joined the chorus of those calling for freshman Republican Rep. George Santos’ resignation after he admitted to lying about parts of his resume. Santos has so far been defiant, pushing back on calls for his resignation, and House GOP leadership has not called on him to do so.\n\n“It’s a fraudulent candidacy – this isn’t an embellished candidacy, it’s a fraudulent candidacy. He hoaxed his voters, so of course he should step down,” Ryan told Tapper.\n\nAsked about his relationship with former President Donald Trump and his recently announced presidential bid, Ryan cast doubt that Trump could win the White House again in 2024.\n\n“He’s fading fast. He’s a proven loser,” Ryan said. “He cost us the House in ’18. He cost us the White House in ‘20. He cost us the Senate again and again, and I think we all know that, and I think we’re moving past Trump.”\n\n“I can’t imagine him getting the [Republican] nomination, frankly,” he added.",

Santos has so far been defiant, pushing back on calls for his resignation, and House GOP leadership has not called on him to do so.\n\n“It’s a fraudulent candidacy – this isn’t an embellished candidacy, it’s a fraudulent candidacy.",

            "content": "The unexpected focus on the classified documents comes at a moment when Biden and his aides had been buoyant over midterm election results that were far better for Democrats than they feared. Biden seemed to revel in the Republican infighting on full display last week when it took 15 ballots before Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was elected House speaker. And the president is widely expected to announce his reelection bid in the coming months, as his approval ratings rise and the economy is on firmer ground.\n\nShe declined to answer questions about whether Biden would be willing to be interviewed by investigators; how and why the documents were taken to his office and home; who had access to the rooms where classified documents were found; and why the White House did not initially reveal that a second batch of documents had been discovered.\n\nThe special counsels, meanwhile, will make charging decisions that will have a far greater impact than the political messaging, Miller added. “One of the things about the politics of Trump — it’s determined by whether he gets indicted or not,” Miller said. “It almost matters less what Biden will say about it than what’s actually playing out in the legal process.”",

But his son Hunter Biden, who is under federal criminal investigation for tax fraud and whom House Republicans plan to subpoena in regard to his foreign business dealings, did have access to the garage. At least, according to earlier statements made by Biden. As vice president in 2016, Biden and his Corvette appeared in the season premiere of CNBC’s “Jay Leno’s Garage.” Showing off the classic that was a wedding present from his father, Biden told Leno that his sons had restored the vehicle to showroom condition.",

            "content": "HILLSBOROUGH, N.J. -- Three Hillsborough police officers saved a 15-year-old boy's life after he went into cardiac arrest while playing basketball for the Saint James School in Basking Ridge.\n\nThe teen collapsed on the court two minutes into the game Saturday at a Hillsborough intermediate school.\n\nBystanders started performing CPR before Officer Tiana Ramos arrived on the scene, according to police.\n\n\"He was blue, not breathing, not responding to any stimuli. So I quickly got my medic bag and hooked up the oxygen,\" said Ramos.\n\nMinutes later, two more officers jumped in to help. Officer Dylan Ely started compressions.\n\n\"The first few minutes in a situation like that is crucial,\" said Ely.\n\n\"I looked to the right and the school's defibrillator was already on the ground, it was already set up. So I looked at someone who was standing over it and I said, 'Hey, hook those pads up to him. Let's try to get this defibrillator hooked up,'\" said Officer Rick Tichenor.\n\n\"After one shock was administered we were able to get a pulse and the child started breathing again and slightly responding to us calling his name,\" said Ramos.\n\n\"It's amazing, not just for us as officers, but for people also. And when it comes down to the family, his dad was there. So we're glad that we were able to bring him back to his dad and get him home,\" said Ely.\n\nThe teen was taken to the hospital in stable condition.\n\n\"Being able to almost see it hands on and providing that care and getting the child back with a pulse and breathing, and now he's standing up in his bed, it's a really rewarding feeling and it's great to see that he's doing well,\" said Ramos.\n\nNew Jersey law requires schools to have defibrillators on hand.\n\n\"It's very simple, the directions are on there. Don't be scared. It'll walk you through the whole thing. Our defibs actually have an audio sequence that will tell you exactly what to do,\" said Tichenor.\n\nHillsborough Police also have them in their patrol cars.",

            "content": "MSNBC legal analyst Barbara McQuade said Thursday on “Chris Jansing Reports” that she believed former President Donald Trump is more likely to get criminally charged because Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed former U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert Hur as special counsel to oversee the investigation into President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents.\n\nMcQuade said, “They both begin with the idea that classified information is supposed to be handled in appropriate ways. There are rules about those things, and failure to do so can violate a number of different statutes. So I imagine in those ways, they are very similar. There will be examination as to whether any of those laws were violated.”\n\nShe continued, “Additional crimes might be presented in the case of Donald Trump just because of the search warrant that we saw before that had additional probable cause for obstruction of justice. That makes it a more complicated crime and a more serious crime potentially. The obstruction of justice allegation was based on the failure of Trump and his team to turn over documents when they received the grand jury subpoena, forcing the government to get a search warrant to go retrieve what turned out to be more than 20 boxes remaining after they had already assured the government that all of the documents had been turned over. So it is a very different scenario from what we have in this case.”\n\nShe added, “I see Robert Hur’s review as potentially small unless it is involved in something else, whereas I see Jack Smith’s investigation as something larger. I would also say this, Chris. I think that the appointment of Robert Hur suggests to me that Jack Smith is serious.”\n\nMcQuade concluded, “I think you need to appoint Robert Hur to show that you are treating these two men equally. It makes me feel that it is more likely charges are going to come against Donald Trump than if no special counsel had been appointed here.”",

            "content": "Clemson is working to hire TCU assistant Garrett Riley as its next offensive coordinator, a person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because a deal was still being finalized and needed approval from the school's Board of Trustees.\n\nThe board's compensation committee had a meeting scheduled for Friday with a lone action item on the agenda: Football assistant coach contract, with athletic director Graham Neff.\n\nNo official announcement can be made until after board approval.\n\nTiger Illustrated was first to report Clemson was targeting Riley as its next offensive coordinator.\n\nTigers coach Dabo Swinney announced earlier Thursday that offensive coordinator Brandon Streeter would not return to the coaching staff. Streeter is a longtime member of Swinney's staff who was promoted to offensive coordinator after last season.\n\nStreeter replaced Tony Elliott, who left Clemson to become head coach at Virginia.\n\nClemson has struggled offensively the last two seasons. The Tigers (11-3) finished last in the Atlantic Coast Conference in yards per play in 2021 (5.17) and improved to eighth in 2022 (5.60) as they won the conference.\n\nRiley, the 33-year-old brother of Southern California coach Lincoln Riley, helped lead TCU (13-2) to its first playoff appearance in his first season with the school.\n\nHe joined the Horned Frogs with first-year head coach Sonny Dykes. TCU ranked 14th in the nation in yards per play at 6.69 and led the country with 22 plays of at least 50 yards.\n\nRiley was also offensive coordinator at SMU under Dykes for two seasons.\n\nFollow Ralph D.

            "description": "The Oregon Shakespeare Festival announced major staff changes this week as it continues to respond to shifting audience and environmental considerations.",
            "content": "The Oregon Shakespeare Festival announced major staff changes this week as it continues to respond to shifting audience and environmental concerns.\n\nThose changes, according to a press release sent out Wednesday, include the immediate departure of executive director David Schmitz and, later in February, the departure of director of development Amanda Brandes, along with “12 staff separations and 7 employee furloughs, as well as putting a stop or delay on hiring 18 open positions.”\n\nArtistic director Nataki Garrett will take over as interim executive artistic director and Amanda Muse, who is currently managing director of inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility (IDEA), people, culture and operations will become interim chief operating officer as well.\n\nThese reductions come after the festival announced cuts to the 2023 season last September, in the wake of seasons where attendance was battered by the global pandemic and wildfires in the area.\n\nRead more: In the face of criticism, Oregon Shakespeare Festival’s Nataki Garrett is building a company for the future\n\nBefore the pandemic and before Garrett began her tenure, the festival was already struggling to cope with the combined pressures of environmental concerns and changing audiences. The 2018 season ended with 26 shows either canceled completely or moved indoors, with $2.3 million in losses and 16 layoffs.\n\nThe festival barely had time to recover from that season when the COVID pandemic ended the 2020 season in its infancy.\n\n“Attendance has not been what it was, pre-pandemic,” departing executive director Schmitz told The Oregonian/OregonLive in September. At that point, he said, attendance for the 2022 season was 46 percent less than it was in 2019.\n\n“Unfortunately, this is something that’s affecting the entire industry,” Schmitz said. “People are not coming in the way they did in the past.”\n\nBut those in charge of the festival are hopeful that these cuts will help right the foundering ship.\n\nAccording to the release, the festival has received a $10 million multi-year gift from The Hitz Foundation as well as $1.5 million in other pledges. The board also has decided to release $4.25 million from its endowment “to help support operating expenses.”\n\nAll these funds, the release said, will support the festival’s “Restructure, Reframe, Revitalize (3Rs) Strategy,” which during the next one to two years will help modernize administrative systems.\n\n“This idea of revitalization is not new to OSF, but the extended pandemic recovery is forcing us to look at it in a different way,” Garrett said in the release. “We spent part of the pandemic focused on restructuring artistic and production practices. We now have an opportunity to turn our eye to parts of our organization that support our artistic efforts and invest in systems that will uplift our Finance, Information Technology, Human Resources, Marketing, and Development departments. We must shift our business model in a way that works successfully in this post-pandemic paradigm.”\n\n“We are revitalizing our business model so we can provide a strong foundation that supports our purpose,” added Muse. “And that purpose is clear: To expand access to the transformational power of art and performance.”\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

            "title": "Idaho senator has mic switched off at school board meeting",
            "description": "A volunteer school board president shut the mic off of Idaho State Sen, Chris Trakel who spoke out against the district's proposed transgender bathroom policy.",
            "content": "An Idaho school board member cut the mic on a State Senator who spoke out against a proposed policy allowing transgender students to use the bathroom corresponding with their gender identity.\n\nNewly-elected State Sen. Chris Trakel, a Republican, spoke during a comment period at the Caldwell School District's Board of Education on Tuesday.\n\nHe argued that the school district, which his children attend, should scrap the proposed policy — warning that the district risks a lawsuit if a young girl feels uncomfortable by the presence of a transgender female in the bathroom.\n\nBut as he continued to speak, School Board President Marisela Pesina decided to cut the mic and adjourned the meeting.\n\nShe claimed he was not following the board's procedures.\n\nTrakel began his comments on Tuesday by noting that he had previously spoken before the board as a parent —but was speaking this time in his official capacity as a state senator.\n\n'You under Idaho law are required to maintain the morals and health of all the students,' he told the school board. 'You allow a male to use a female bathroom, you're gonna put them all of their moral health and safety at risk.'\n\nHe then went on to say that the school district risked being sued, noting: 'It's already happened in several states and there's already been rulings on it.\n\n'So before you waste taxpayer money, before you put a kid in harms way, you better throw this policy out and not even consider...'\n\nBut as he spoke, he noticed that Pesina had turned her head toward another board member.\n\n'I've got the floor, Ms. Pesina, will you please listen to me?'\n\nApparently startled, Pesina turned her head back toward the state senator, who told her: 'You claim you want people to follow the rules, but you break the rules left and right,' bringing up an incident from the previous board meeting.\n\nAt that point, Pesina said the board would recess for 15 minutes, telling Trakel, 'I'm sorry, we have asked you. [You] absolutely know the protocol.'\n\nTrakel, in turn, replied: 'You're not following the protocol yourself.'\n\nSensing the tension in the room, one of the other board members moved to adjourn the meeting and Pesina took the opportunity to ask for a second.\n\n'No!' someone in the crowd shouted. 'Your people are speaking.'\n\nBut another school board member seconded the move, at which point Trakel brought up the state law regarding open meetings.\n\n'Section 74-201: The people of the state of Idaho, in creating the instruments of government that serve them, do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies so created...'\n\nThat is when Pesina called on whoever was controlling the sound system to shut off his mic, which immediately went dead.\n\nShe used the opportunity to call for a vote on whether to adjourn, as the crowd continued to shout.\n\nThe school board was meeting on Tuesday to discuss a proposed new policy regarding gender identity.\n\nUnder the proposal, KTVB reports, students would be able to use different school facilities 'based on the gender identity they most express at school.'\n\nParents would be asked to meet with the school's principal or school administrator to understand the student's needs in an effort to develop a plan that is 'in the best interest of the student.' That plan would then be signed by all of the parties involved, noting the consensus and any dissenting opinions.\n\nBut another section, 'confidentiality,' says that when staff talk to the parents of a transgender student they would have to use the student's legal name and pronouns corresponding to the gender the student was assigned at birth unless a previously agreed upon plan says otherwise.\n\nOther sections of the proposed policy would allow a student to go on overnight trips regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity and would allow school activities that are separated by gender 'in a manner that is consistent with their gender identity consistently expressed at school.'\n\nJessica Watts, the district's director of communications, told KTVB the policy is proposed but is 'still being vetted.'\n\nAt the school board meeting on Tuesday, several students and parents spoke, offering differing opinions on the proposal.\n\nThree high school students began the public comment period by speaking in favor of the proposal, saying the district should be at the forefront of transgender rights.\n\n'I'm a firm believer that all student, and not only [in] the Caldwell School District, but across the whole world deserve to be treated with respect, no matter their sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression,' a high schooler named Nicholas said.\n\n'The struggles that you might not experience yourself do not mean they don't exist,' he continued, noting: 'Many of us here identify with the gender that we were assigned [and] feel attraction to the opposite gender.\n\n'This might make you feel like LGBTQ rights are not a problem or something you should worry about, but that is far from the case,' Nicholas said.\n\n'We should be fighting for the rights of all people, even people that are different from yourself. We, as a school district, should be fighting for the equality of all students in the Caldwell School District.'\n\nBut he was immediately followed by a middle schooler who said she doesn't think 'that it's right for a boy who feels like he's a girl to change in the same room as the girls because it would make us all feel very uncomfortable changing with a boy in the room.\n\n'And I don't think that they should be allowed in the same bathroom as the girls because they make everybody feel very uncomfortable to be using the bathrooms with a boy.'\n\nA woman also said that there are 'only two genders, that's it' and 'teaching is for reading, writing and arithmetic.\n\n'It is not to sexualize our kids,' she said. 'That is not what our tax dollars are to go for.'\n\nShe then went on to suggest that the board could face consequences for the proposal.\n\n'Another thing, we pay your guys' wage, we voted for you. We can vote you out,' the woman said, as people in the crowd replied: 'Amen.'\n\nThat seemed to be the first time Pesina recognized there was a growing threat to the order of the school board meeting, saying: 'OK, we can stop this meeting. I've already asked you, folks.\n\n'And just for the record, we don't get paid.'\n\nBut the woman seemed to continue her threats, saying: 'I want to tell you something, everybody is going to answer to God one day, You're not going to escape it in any way.'\n\nFollowing the chaotic meeting, Trakel told the Daily Beast: 'I understand where they're coming from, They need a policy to follow.\n\n'You have a transgender child who doesn't want to use the birth sex bathroom that he's in, it puts that child in a situation,' the state senator acknowledged.\n\n'So I understand the school's looking for something, looking for a policy. They don't want to be sued.\n\n'They're trying to just have the best interests of all the students in mind.'\n\nMeanwhile, the school district released a statement saying, 'It was disappointing that some attending refused to follow the rules, which prevented others from sharing their thoughts with the Board.\n\n'Caldwell School District welcomes and encourages feedback on its work,' it continued.\n\n'What we do not welcome are those who refuse to follow the steps necessary for a civil, courteous and respectful environment for that feedback to occur.'",

            "description": "Mr. Hur spent time during the Trump administration as a top aide in the Justice Department when it installed a special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation.",
            "content": "Robert K. Hur in 2017, when he was the top aide to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nMr. Hur spent time during the Trump administration as a top aide in the Justice Department when it installed a special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation.\n\nWASHINGTON — Robert K. Hur, appointed on Thursday to oversee the investigation into President Biden’s handling of classified documents, has two attributes that suit the task — years of prosecutorial experience and a vivid understanding of the perils inherent in high-wire special counsel investigations. Mr. Hur, 49, was President Donald J. Trump’s pick to run the U.S. attorney’s office in Maryland, where he earned bipartisan praise for his handling of violent crime and public corruption cases. But it is his 11-month stint as the top aide to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein — as Mr. Rosenstein oversaw the appointment of a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to investigate Mr. Trump’s dealings with Russia — that might be most critical. Mr. Hur helped run the day-to-day operations of the department at a time of major tumult in the department: From mid-2017 to late 2018, Mr. Rosenstein was under relentless political pressure, under threat of being fired by Mr. Trump over his decision to appoint Mr. Mueller, which the president considered a personal betrayal. “We were coming under tremendous criticism from the commentators — and the president — and Rob kept his head down, pushed ahead and never lost his sense of humor,” Mr. Rosenstein said in an interview after Mr. Hur’s appointment was announced.\n\n“This is a very different task than anything he’s done before,” Mr. Rosenstein said, adding that he thought Mr. Hur was the ideal pick. “Every special counsel starts with a sterling reputation, but no one finishes up that way.” But Mr. Hur’s crucible moment came later, after he left Mr. Rosenstein’s staff to become the top prosecutor in Maryland. Geoffrey S. Berman, the Trump-era U.S. attorney in Manhattan, wrote about Mr. Hur in his memoir, “Holding the Line,” which accuses the Justice Department under Mr. Trump of trying to use prosecutors in Manhattan to support Mr. Trump politically and pursue his critics. According to Mr. Berman, the Justice Department pushed his office to investigate John F. Kerry, the secretary of state in the Obama administration, who had angered Mr. Trump by trying to preserve the nuclear deal he had negotiated with Iran. After Mr. Berman’s office decided not to bring criminal charges against Mr. Kerry, he wrote, Attorney General William P. Barr reassigned the matter to Mr. Hur, who called Mr. Berman to ask about it. “I went through the whole thing, explained our reasons for declining, and urged Hur to do the same,” Mr. Berman wrote. Mr. Hur came to “the same conclusion we did, and the Kerry investigation just quietly died — as it should have,” he added.\n\nThat was not an aberration, officials said. Mr. Hur made a point of ensuring that politics did not affect his office. Aaron S.J. Zelinsky, who was one of four prosecutors to abruptly quit working on the prosecution of a longtime Trump ally, Roger J. Stone Jr., accused senior officials of intervening in the Stone case to seek a lighter sentence. When he returned to the Maryland office, Mr. Zelinsky found that Mr. Hur treated him fairly and without rancor. How Times reporters cover politics.

In selecting Mr. Hur, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland is continuing a pattern of asking current and former Trump-appointed U.S. attorneys to handle politically sensitive investigations — like the inquiry into the president’s son, Hunter Biden — to allay any concerns about political bias. By contrast, Mr. Barr repeatedly used fellow Trump appointees to oversee politically charged investigations that arose on his watch, including a review of the Russia investigation; the prosecution of Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn; and allegations that proved to be false, that Obama officials had illegally “unmasked” Trump campaign associates in intelligence reports. Mr. Garland said he decided to choose Mr. Hur after a preliminary investigation into classified documents found at a Washington think tank and Mr. Biden’s house in Wilmington, Del., prompted the appointment of a special counsel under department rules. In November, Mr. Garland offered much the same explanation for picking Jack Smith, a veteran war crimes prosecutor, to oversee concurrent investigations into Mr. Trump’s mishandling of classified documents and his actions surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. “This appointment underscores for the public the department’s commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters, and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law,” Mr. Garland told reporters during a brief appearance on Thursday.\n\nMr. Hur promised to “conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial and dispassionate judgment,” in a statement that closely tracked Mr. Smith’s comments after he was appointed. “I intend to follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly, without fear or favor, and will honor the trust placed in me to perform this service.” Mr. Hur, who has been listed as a registered Republican in Maryland, received his undergraduate degree from Harvard and graduated from Stanford Law School, where he served as executive editor of the law review. After serving as clerk for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and a federal appellate judge, Mr. Hur took a job as a top aide to the current F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, who was then the chief of the Justice Department’s criminal division. He went on to work as a federal prosecutor in Maryland from 2007 to 2014, tackling a wide variety of cases. Former colleagues remember him as tough and smart — with somewhat less of a gung-ho reputation than the hard-charging Mr. Smith. In Baltimore, Mr. Hur was known for his public corruption investigations of Democratic politicians in the city and at the Maryland State House. He brought charges against Baltimore’s former mayor, two of the city’s state legislators — all Democrats — and the city’s police chief. He also cracked down on corruption in the city’s police force and in the state’s prison system, and he won convictions against gang members and the shooter of a 3-year-old girl, a crime that rocked the city. Mr. Hur often cast his prosecutions as the accountability needed to begin cleaning up the city. After his office won a conviction against Catherine E. Pugh, the former Baltimore mayor, Mr. Hur said his actions were intended to address the city’s “many pressing issues” of crime and poverty. “We need dedication and professionalism from our leaders, not fraud and corruption, if we have any hope of fixing the problems,” he said in 2019. His record of rooting out corruption by Democrats in Baltimore suggests that Republicans in Washington could be less likely to view his decisions with skepticism as he considers the case of Mr. Biden.",

Mueller III, to investigate Mr. Trump’s dealings with Russia — that might be most critical. Mr. Hur helped run the day-to-day operations of the department at a time of major tumult in the department: From mid-2017 to late 2018, Mr. Rosenstein was under relentless political pressure, under threat of being fired by Mr. Trump over his decision to appoint Mr. Mueller, which the president considered a personal betrayal. Geoffrey S. Berman, the Trump-era U.S. attorney in Manhattan, wrote about Mr. Hur in his memoir, “Holding the Line,” which accuses the Justice Department under Mr. Trump of trying to use prosecutors in Manhattan to support Mr. Trump politically and pursue his critics. After Mr. Berman’s office decided not to bring criminal charges against Mr. Kerry, he wrote, Attorney General William P. Barr reassigned the matter to Mr. Hur, who called Mr. Berman to ask about it.",

            "content": "With limited battlefield wins and its status as a global pariah firmly in place, Russia is struggling to find leverage to wear down Western resolve to aid Ukraine as its war in the country nears the end of its first year.\n\nWe’ll share what experts are saying about Russian President Vladimir Putin and his options left in the war, plus how Ukrainian officials are pushing the West to send tanks.\n\nAlso: Details on the Navy veteran recently released from Russian detainment and President Biden’s words of praise at the service for the late former Defense Secretary Ash Carter.\n\nThis is Defense & National Security, your guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. For The Hill, I’m Ellen Mitchell. A friend forward this newsletter to you?\n\nPutin exhausting options to wear down aid to Ukraine\n\nAs the Russia-Ukraine war nears the end of its first year, Moscow is struggling to find leverage to wear down Western resolve to aid Kyiv.\n\nWith its battlefield wins now few and far between, an economy crippled by harsh sanctions, and increasing international isolation, Russian President Vladimir Putin is running out of options to expand its provocations beyond Ukraine to chip away at international support for Ukraine’s resistance, experts say.\n\n‘Only getting worse’: The Kremlin has “basically lost on all fronts in terms of trying to exhaust and create fractures in the coalition between Ukraine and its Western allies,” according to Joseph Dresen, a Russia expert at the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute. “I think Russia is in a bad situation. It’s been bad for a while. It’s only getting worse.”\n\nEarly roadblocks: When Moscow rolled its forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russia expected the country to quickly surrender, failing to anticipate a mountain of resistance. Among the roadblocks for Moscow was the resolve of the Ukrainian people, the leadership of the then-untested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the ill-prepared Kremlin troops.\n\nWhat’s more, the former Soviet nation quickly galvanized Western support, with the U.S. and Europe funneling tens of billions of dollars’ worth of weapons and humanitarian aid to the embattled country.\n\nFailed attempts: Moscow has tried to weaken global resolve to aid Kyiv, using cyberattacks, shipping blockades to prevent crucial grain exports, freezing gas supplies for Europe and threatening to halt all energy imports, a move Putin said would cause the continent to “freeze.”\n\nBut a warm winter combined with an international community that has collectively responded to each Russian threat with its own pushback — either through bolstered cyber defenses, energy replacements or economic sanctions — has kept Putin on his back foot.\n\nLimited bandwidth: Now, after more than 320 days of a conflict the Russian leader initially claimed would last less than a week, Moscow is all but out of ways to wreak havoc outside of Ukraine.\n• “I just don’t think they have the bandwidth to project power anyplace else right now,” Brian Whitmore, a Russian expert with the Atlantic Council, told The Hill.\n• “I think their play was effectively freezing out Europe and making them suffer through the winter. That’s clearly not going to work right now,” Whitmore said. “They’re counting on the West’s resolve being diminished, and that’s not happened yet. … I don’t think we’re gonna get there, quite frankly.”\n\nOther losses: Further limiting Putin’s options was Russia’s swift loss of economic relations with the West, a forfeiture of decades of painstakingly cultivated ties and an ousting from an information network Moscow can no longer use to its advantage.\n\nUkrainian defense officials are zeroing in on tank deliveries from the U.S. and European partners, saying the firepower and security provided by the armored artillery vehicles will keep up the momentum in its efforts to rout invading Russian forces.\n\nThe Biden administration has increased the heavy artillery it is providing Ukraine, but has done so slowly and incrementally to protect against perceptions that Washington is provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPushing for tanks: Ukrainian officials have welcomed the Biden administration’s recent announcement to supply armored vehicles with machine guns — Bradley fighting vehicles — but are pushing for Washington to commit to sending Abrams tanks.\n\n“Bradley’s are like a sandwich, it is good when you’re hungry. But an Abrams is like a full meal, it will really leave you satisfied,” Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s minister of defense, told The Hill.\n\nAn important signal: Ukrainian officials say an announcement by the Biden administration that it would supply tanks would send an important political signal to Putin and Russia that the U.S. and its allies are united in their support.\n\nAnd it would also push back against concerns that a new Republican House majority threatens bipartisan backing for Kyiv, or that Europe’s solidarity is fracturing in the face of Moscow’s havoc, they say.\n\nWhat’s needed: Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, told The Economist last month that Kyiv needs 300 tanks to achieve a decisive victory on the battlefield against Russia, along with 700 infantry fighting vehicles and 500 howitzers.\n\n“I know that I can beat this enemy. But I need resources,” Zaluzhnyi told the Economist.\n\nPresident Biden on Thursday eulogized former Defense Secretary Ash Carter as an innovative public servant who advanced the military’s strength and diversity through his work.\n\nBiden spoke at a memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral for Carter, who died in October after a sudden heart attack. He was 68.\n\nPaying tribute: “This is beyond my capacity to accurately assess what an incredible man Ash was,” Biden said. “Ash was a force. He was a force of nature. His genius was evident, his integrity unfailing and his commitment to service before self was literally inspiring.”\n\nA storied legacy: Carter started his career as a physicist and spent decades serving in the Pentagon, ultimately leading the Defense Department from 2015 to 2017 while Biden was vice president. During that time, Carter oversaw efforts to increase nuclear deterrence, manage emerging technologies and strategize the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda.\n\nCarter also tackled numerous personnel matters during his tenure, including ending a ban on transgender officers in the military and opening all military positions to women in 2016 — the first time in U.S. history that women could enter certain combat roles previously only open to men.\n\nA military made stronger: Biden on Thursday argued the military had been made “stronger and more inclusive by Ash’s principles and convictions.”\n\n“I stand today as commander in chief of, as Ash always said, the finest fighting force the world has ever known, and that is not hyperbole,” Biden said.\n\nRUSSIA RELEASES US NAVY VETERAN AFTER NEARLY A YEAR\n\nRussia on Thursday released a U.S. Navy veteran after nearly a year of detention in a Russian province between Poland and Lithuania.\n\n“Today, the Russian govt released my client, Taylor Dudley, a Navy vet, cross the Polish border,” Jonathan Franks, a spokesperson for the family, tweeted Thursday morning, saying he and the family were en route to Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat we know: Dudley, 35, of Michigan, was detained in April after crossing into Kaliningrad, a Russian province on the Baltic Sea bordered to the north and east by Lithuania and to the south by Poland.\n\nHis detention was not widely publicized because his family wanted to keep the negotiations private, according to CNN.\n\nSecuring the release: The Richardson Center for Global Engagement, a nonprofit founded by former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson (D), led negotiations for his release.\n\nThe Steve Menzies Global Foundation, the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw and the James Foley Foundation also helped secure the release of Dudley, according to a statement Franks issued to CNN.\n• President Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for meetings at the White House\n• Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service will host a discussion on “Displacement and Disabilities in Ukraine What’s Happened to Children with Disabilities in the Conflict?” at 12 p.m.\n• What we know about the Biden documents so far\n• House Democrats call on Biden to revoke Bolsonaro’s diplomatic visa after Brazilian rioting\n• The world has entered the fifth wave of anti-government terrorism\n• House China committee’s mission: Military imbalance is foremost among many challenges\n\nThat’s it for today!

            "title": "Ana Walshe told police in 2014 that Brian Walshe had threated to kill her, report says - The Boston Globe",
            "description": "Ana Walshe told Metropolitan Police in Washington, D.C., that a man threatened her during a telephone call and said “he was going to kill (her) and her friend,” according to a police report.",
            "content": "About a year before they were engaged, Ana Walshe — then Ana Knipp — told Metropolitan Police in Washington, D.C., that a man threatened her during a telephone call and said “he was going to kill (her) and her friend,” according to a police report.\n\nAna Walshe, the 39-year-old mother of three last seen in Cohasset in the early hours of Jan. 1, told police in 2014 that her now-husband had threatened to kill her, according to a police report and a person briefed on the matter.\n\nThe report does not identify the man by name, but noted that the suspect lives in Boston. A person with knowledge of the current investigation into Walshe’s disappearance told the Globe that her now-husband, Brian R. Walshe, is the suspect identified in the report.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said the case was closed after Ana Walshe declined to cooperate with the investigation, though the spokesperson could not say when that occurred.\n\nThe sudden disappearance of Walshe, a Serbian immigrant who worked at ritzy hotels and in high-end real estate, has sparked national attention. Her husband, Brian Walshe was recently convicted in federal court in an elaborate art forgery and fraud scheme. He is currently jailed and charged with deceiving local police in the investigation into his wife’s disappearance.\n\nAuthorities have been carrying out an extensive search since she was first reported missing by coworkers on Jan. 4, three days after her husband told police he last saw her.\n\nAna Walshe relocated to Washington, D.C. from Massachusetts last year for a high-profile real estate job, and had been returning to Cohasset on weekends to be with her husband and three sons. She purchased a $1.3 million home in D.C.’s Chevy Chase neighborhood last March.\n\nShe previously lived for several years in Washington, court records show. She met Brian Walshe in 2008 at the Wheatleigh Hotel in Lenox and they had a long distance relationship for many years, before she moved to Massachusetts in 2015, according to a court filing in her husband’s fraud case.\n\nShe reported the death threat to Metro Police on Aug. 3, 2014. She said the threat came the evening prior and that it was made in a phone call, according to the document, which was first reported by Boston 25 News. The report listed her address as an apartment in the 400 block of Massachusetts Avenue NW.\n\nBrian Walshe had also lived at that address, records show. He was sued by a debt collection company in June 2015 for owing more than $25,000 and had listed that address, according to D.C. Superior Court records.\n\nThe couple obtained their marriage license in December 2015 and married shortly after at the Church of the Covenant in Boston, according to Ana Walshe’s Facebook page.\n\nBrian Walshe is being held on $500,000 bail. He pleaded not guilty to making false statements. He is currently awaiting sentencing in the federal fraud case.\n\nAuthorities announced this week that investigators discovered blood and a damaged, bloodied knife in the basement of the Walshes’ Cohasset home. They also said that security footage showed Brian Walshe — wearing mask and gloves — purchasing $450 in cleaning supplies from a Rockland Home Deport shortly after Ana Walsh’s disappearance.\n\nAuthorities have also searched the Walshes’ home and surrounding wooded areas, as well as dumpsters near the Swampscott home of Brian Walshe’s mother, a transfer station in Peabody, and a waste-to-energy facility south of Boston in Wareham. Two law enforcement officials briefed on the case told the Globe that investigators recovered a hacksaw and blood evidence in trash at the Peabody transfer station.\n\nSee the Globe’s full coverage of this case.\n\nDugan Arnett can be reached at dugan.arnett@globe.com.

            "content": "Google said a Supreme Court ruling could “upend the internet” in a new brief that showcases the tech giant’s argument in a case scheduled for oral arguments next month.\n\nMeanwhile, the millions of customers who lost money from the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange could get their money back, the founder said Thursday.\n\nThis is Hillicon Valley, detailing all you need to know about tech and cyber news from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley. For The Hill I’m Rebecca Klar. Subscribe here.\n\nGoogle says high court could ‘upend the internet’\n\nGoogle argued that if the Supreme Court rules to scale back a liability shield for internet companies the decision could lead to more censorship and hate speech online, according to a brief filed Thursday.\n\nThe filing showcases Google’s argument in a case facing the high court that centers around Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a controversial provision that protects companies from being sued over content posted by third parties.\n• “Gutting Section 230… would upend the internet and perversely encourage both wide-ranging suppression of speech and the proliferation of more offensive speech,” the filing states.\n• Sites with resources to take down objectionable content could “become beholden to heckler’s vetoes, removing anything anyone found objectionable,” while other sides could take “the see-no-evil approach” and disable filtering to “avoid any interference of constructive knowledge of third-party content,” the company argued.\n\nThe case is based on allegations against Google raised by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old U.S. citizen killed in a 2015 Islamic State terror attack in France.\n\nGonzalez’s family alleges Google-owned YouTube provided a platform for terrorist content and recommended content inciting violence and recruiting potential Islamic State supporters through YouTube’s recommendation algorithm.\n\nMoney could come to FTX customers, founder says\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried on Thursday said the millions of customers who lost money from the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange could get their money back.\n\nBankman-Fried said in a Substack post that three factors combined to cause the “implosion” of FTX — the balance sheet of his hedge fund, Alameda Research, growing to $100 billion of net asset value, $8 billion of net borrowing and $7 billion of liquidity on hand; Alameda not successfully limiting its market exposure; and an “extreme, quick, targeted” crash caused by the head of another cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\n• Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas last month and is facing a variety of charges including wire fraud and securities fraud. The controversy surrounding him and FTX arose after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in November due to being unable to provide billions of dollars for customers’ withdrawal requests.\n• He was extradited from the Bahamas to stand trial in Manhattan and has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nThe Coalition for App Fairness, an advocacy group that names Spotify, Match Group and Epic Games among its members, sent a letter to administration officials urging them to ensure digital competition is considered during upcoming negotiations for the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).\n\nIn a letter sent to the U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, the group warned about dominant tech platforms using the IPEF as a “backdoor mechanism to tie the Administration’s and Congress’s hands as they grapple with critical big tech regulatory and legislative reform.”\n\nThe letter also urges the officials to ensure nondiscrimination rules “distinguish between facially neutral policies, which may have a greater impact on larger firms, versus intentionally discriminatory policies that target firms by nationality.”\n• The Coalition for App Fairness has been advocating for bills aimed at revamping antitrust laws. Particularly, last year the group backed the Open App Markets Act, which would have added rules banning dominant app stores like Google and Apple from certain rules they have in place, such as charging up to 30 percent commission fees from in-app purchases.\n• The bill advanced out of the Judiciary committees in the House and Senate but failed to make it across the finish line. Apple and Google defended their app store rules against accusations of anticompetitive behavior.\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: Big labor’s attacks on the gig economy are anti-worker\n\nNotable links from around the web:\n\nThe US government is still trying to find ways to regulate Big Tech. He has some ideas (CNN / Brian Fung)\n\nAviation warning system that crashed was already a pain for pilots (NBC News / Kevin Collier) \n\n\n\n\n\nOne more thing: FAA outage stretches on\n\nA wave of flight delays and cancellations rippled into Thursday after a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) system outage grounded and canceled flights all over the U.S. on Wednesday.\n\nNearly 9,000 flights were delayed on Thursday, according to FlightAware, an online flight tracker. More than 1,200 flights were canceled.\n\nThe FAA temporarily ordered a pause on all flights Wednesday morning as it worked to fix an issue with its Notice to Air Mission (NOTAM) system, which communicates real-time flight hazards to pilots. More than 6,500 flights were delayed on Wednesday. The FAA eventually lifted the pause later Wednesday morning.\n\nAfter Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the federal government was not ruling out nefarious activity in the outage, the FAA blamed a corrupted database file for the failure.\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

            "content": "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Last spring, Republican and DFL leaders announced they struck a deal with Gov. Tim Walz that including all social security benefits from state taxes.\n\nThat compromise fell apart before session ended, never becoming law. But on Thursday, lawmakers in the Senate taxes committee pushed restart on discussing that proposal, which is already a sticking point among Democrats who have power in both chambers of the legislature.\n\n\"This bill is about money. But it's also about what, and more importantly whom, we value,\" said Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud, the bill's author, during committee.\n\nUnder current law, social security recipients can subtract some of those benefits from their taxable income. The formula to determine how much depends on filing status calculation that accounts for half of those benefits and adjusted gross income, known as \"provisional income.\"\n\nAbout half of filers who get the benefits don't pay taxes on social security already, according to the Minnesota Department of Revenue. But passing the bill to repeal all taxes on the payments would impact 473,000 people with an average tax savings of $1,276.\n\nPutnam and a few other DFL legislators join Republicans, who also want to full exemption of social security benefits. But other Democrats, including DFL legislative leaders and now Gov. Tim Walz don't share the same position, raising concerns that the plan benefits the wealthiest in the state who don't need the tax break while slashing the state budget.\n\n\"It has exploding tails, meaning it's very expensive in the future,\" said House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, during a news conference last week. \"If we're going to do something like that, we need to know what happens in future years to our investments and things like public schools. So we'll very carefully consider that proposal. It is in the mix.\"\n\nIf passed, it would be a $604 million hit to state revenues in 2024 that increases in years after, a Department of Revenue estimate shows.\n\nStill, others remain firm that full exemption is a top priority, setting up an intraparty battle that is likely to take many months of session to find common ground. Putnam's bill also creates a new subtraction for a new subtraction for some Minnesotans who have public pensions.\n\nSen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, and three other newly-elected DFL senators who helped deliver the one-seat majority in the chamber say the bill is a top budget priority. Issue repeatedly came up in discussions with voters on the campaign trail.\n\n\"I heard ad nauseam from seniors and those nearing retirement how critical this issue was,\" Hauschild said during the committee hearing. \"With correspondence from my constituents since the election, I would say 90% -- that's an estimation but about 90% -- have told me how important this issue is.\"\n\nSocial security was a key win for Republicans in a tax agreement between chambers last spring that ultimately didn't pass as negotiations on other spending broke down. Republicans also want to cut tax rates for ongoing savings, though that's unlikely to happen in the DFL-led legislature.\n\n\"As we look at not only social security but our income tax rates, it's the combination of a variety of things that leads people to say, 'I will not live in Minnesota for six months and a day,'\" said Sen. Bill Werner, R-Luverne.\n\nThere will be a public hearing on the proposal next week.",

            "content": "Mayor Eric Adams said his proposed budget maintained funding for what he said were his primary concerns: safety, housing and sanitation.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nMayor Eric Adams wants to retain funding for safety, housing and sanitation but predicts future deficits as the city’s economy struggles to recover fully.\n\nFacing an uncertain economy, Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday proposed a nearly $103 billion budget that reflected a long list of looming challenges for New York City, from multibillion-dollar deficits to the accumulating costs of thousands of migrants continuing to enter the city. For the first time in at least a decade, the mayor has proposed cutting the budget from the current year’s adjusted spending plan — by roughly $5 billion, according to an analysis by the Citizens Budget Commission. Yet Mr. Adams intends to maintain funding for what he said were his primary concerns: safety, housing and sanitation, a category that includes his battle against rats. “As our city continues its recovery, our administration continues to make investments in our core priorities — including public safety, affordable housing and clean streets — while exercising strong fiscal management,” Mr. Adams said.\n\nDespite efforts to restrain spending, the city is still predicting substantial deficits in the coming years. The drop-off in this year’s spending proposal is largely due to the waning of federal pandemic aid, the budget commission said. City funding declined less. Budget experts say those deficits do not account for the substantial upcoming costs of settling the city’s municipal labor contracts and recurring costs from the thousands of migrants moving to New York City. The city does not “yet have enough reserves to navigate us through a recession,” said Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, in a statement. “Key areas remain underbudgeted, including police overtime, housing vouchers and likely increases in labor costs.” Nearly three years into the pandemic, the city’s economy is still struggling to recover. Its unemployment rate exceeds the national average, with the arts and entertainment, food and hospitality sectors continuing to trail their prepandemic highs. The city’s homeless population is at record levels. Commercial landlords, who pay a sizable chunk of the city’s tax revenue, are still struggling to fill office buildings. Late last year, Mr. Adams ordered city agencies to cut city-funded expenses by 3 percent for the current fiscal year and 4.75 percent for the following year. City Council leaders have criticized those cuts, particularly those to libraries and preschool programs for 3-year-olds.\n\nLibrary leaders have warned that the mayor’s budget would cost libraries $20 million next year and could lead to painful reductions in hours and programming. It was hard to immediately discern how Mr. Adams’s spending plan would affect city services; Justin Brannan, the chair of the Council’s committee on finance, described the proposed budget as so lacking in detail as to be “skeletal.” Still, Council leaders fear the worst. The Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, said in an interview this week that the Council had a “different vision for our city” from the mayor. “We will not allow our city to be damaged by the undermining of city agencies and services that meet the essential needs of all New Yorkers,” she said in a statement with Mr. Brannan on Thursday. “We are committed to delivering for New Yorkers, and we are prepared to fight to realize our vision in this year’s budget.” Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, faulted the mayor on Thursday for failing to anticipate recurring migrant-related costs in his budget documents. “The city must lay out these and other risks transparently so that it may continue to plan and identify new ways to close these gaps without harming services, which would be counterproductive to the city, and state’s, economic recovery,” Mr. DiNapoli said. Mr. Adams said on Thursday that the city’s revenue forecast includes an additional $1.7 billion this fiscal year, which ends in June, driven by “continued momentum from the record Wall Street activity in 2021.” But he acknowledged that the city was expected to see slowing growth in tax revenue over the next year.\n\n“Although the economy has been strong, it’s slowing,” he said. After his first year as mayor, Mr. Adams has argued that he is starting to make progress on public safety by reducing the number of shootings and murders. But major crimes surged 22 percent last year. City officials said that funding for the Police Department would remain largely flat, and Mr. Adams defended his support for the agency, which typically has a $10 billion annual budget. “I am not going to trade off public safety,” he told reporters, adding that New Yorkers “feel safe when they see that blue uniform.” A staffing crisis in municipal government has slowed the work of critical agencies. The city continues to bleed personnel, with its current head count at 301,000, compared with 304,096 at the end of June, according to numbers provided by the Citizens Budget Commission. Affordable housing production cannot keep up with demand or production levels of previous years, and the city has failed to meet its legally mandated bus- and bike-lane construction targets. The Human Resources Administration is struggling to process food stamp payments in a timely fashion, according to a recent report in City Limits. Mr. Lander warned on Thursday that cuts to vacant city jobs could harm key services, and he said that the budget was not ambitious or focused. “This budget meanders with little direction,” he said. Despite criticism from City Council members, Mr. Adams said he wanted to work with Ms. Adams, the Council speaker, and called her a friend.",

            "title": "Column: Republicans have rediscovered fiscal conservatism. Don't believe it for a minute.",
            "description": "House Republicans talk tough on the deficit, but their new rules allow for the same old GOP fiscal fakery.",
            "content": "With a Democrat inhabiting the White House, perhaps the most predictable thing about House Republicans’ return to power is this: They’ve rediscovered their faux fiscal conservatism.\n\nAll week members of the Republican majority have been chest-beating about how, thanks to the new House rules they devised, they will restore rectitude to federal budgeting. Income will be balanced against spending and debt reduced, just as American families have to do at their kitchen tables.\n\nDon’t take that promise to the bank. It’ll bounce. And not because Republicans are up against the supposedly profligate Democrats who control the White House and Senate. As we begin what’s sure to be a chaotic two years of Republican governance in the House, a little fiscal history is in order, no green eyeshades needed.\n\nIn short, Republicans forfeited the title “fiscal conservatives” so long ago, most Americans weren’t even born yet.\n\nA fiscal conservative advocates for small government and low taxes but is open to higher taxes if necessary to erase deficits. That kind of thinking defined the Republican Party for most of the 20th century.\n\nStarting with the Reagan era, however, the party flipped its orthodoxy on its head: Republicans became so anti-tax that each time their party took power, they willfully drove up deficits in the higher cause of slashing taxes for businesses and the rich. And each time, Republicans’ claims that the tax cuts would pay for themselves (economic growth!) were disproved by the record — Reagan’s, George W. Bush’s and Donald Trump’s.\n\nYet to hear House Republicans lately, you’d think Democrats and a few RINOs were responsible for the entire $31-trillion gross federal debt. Heck, we’re still paying on debt from Bush’s administration, when, for six of his eight years, Republicans also controlled Congress. Republicans’ red ink, which quickly washed away a budget surplus Bush had inherited, flowed largely from tax cuts, an unnecessary war in Iraq and a big, unfunded domestic program, Medicare Part D, to cover seniors’ prescription drugs.\n\nDemocrats for years had wanted to add a drug benefit for older Americans, but were stymied by the cost; in 1990, they’d agreed with the first President Bush (a true fiscal conservative, mostly) that new tax cuts or spending on entitlement programs like Medicare would be paid for with separate spending cuts or tax increases. The second Bush and his Republican allies simply got rid of the rule, so they could cut taxes and enact Part D, deficits be damned. (As Vice President Dick Cheney famously said, deficits didn’t matter anymore.)\n\nDemocrats, in true fiscally conservative fashion, revived the “pay as you go” rule when they regained power in Congress. President Obama’s Affordable Care Act was mostly paid for with spending cuts and new taxes on businesses that stood to benefit from additional paying patients. When Trump was elected and Republicans took charge again, those taxes were repealed, adding some Obamacare debt to the nation’s tab and once again rendering Republican claims to fiscal rectitude hollow.\n\nThat move was responsible for just a fraction of the debt we’re now shouldering from Trump’s tenure. Lest the former president’s defenders rush to argue that he was blindsided by a costly pandemic, know this: Before COVID-19 struck, Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress had piled up nearly $5 trillion in debt, projected over a decade, from both higher spending and tax cuts. That’s according to the (truly) fiscally conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nTrump left behind almost $8 trillion in total debt after four years, more than either the second Bush or Obama did in each man’s eight years as president, as the conservative Manhattan Institute found.\n\nDid the purported deficit-hawk Republicans now running the House complain? Of course not. On that, like any other outrage of the Trump years, they were silent. And complicit.\n\nBut they’ve found their voices now that Joe Biden is president, although their tough talk goes only so far: Tax cuts don’t have to be paid for under the new Republican rules, which require that only of some new spending.\n\nThree times during Trump’s term, Republicans quietly went along in raising the federal debt limit, so that the government could keep borrowing to cover costs that they, along with past presidents and Congresses, had run up on the nation’s credit card. No drama, no conditions. Yet even before House Republicans won power in the midterm elections, they were promising to hold the debt limit hostage unless Biden and Democrats would agree to huge spending cuts.\n\n“We’re not just going to keep lifting your credit card limit, right?” then-minority leader and now Speaker Kevin McCarthy said in October.\n\n“Your” credit card, says the man who’s been a member of Congress for 16 years, and in the House Republican leadership for 14. Over time, he voted for countless unfunded tax cuts and more spending than he’d admit to.\n\nRaising the debt limit doesn’t add a cent to deficits and debt; it merely ensures that the government can pay existing bills. But refusing to raise it could be catastrophic, for the nation and for a global economy that relies on the United States for a stable dollar. When House Republicans seriously flirted with blocking a debt ceiling increase in 2011, under Obama, the threat rocked markets.\n\nTo play this game again would be the most fiscally irresponsible and least fiscally conservative thing that Republicans could do. But as history warns us, don’t put it past them. They’re fiscal fakers.",

President Obama’s Affordable Care Act was mostly paid for with spending cuts and new taxes on businesses that stood to benefit from additional paying patients. Lest the former president’s defenders rush to argue that he was blindsided by a costly pandemic, know this: Before COVID-19 struck, Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress had piled up nearly $5 trillion in debt, projected over a decade, from both higher spending and tax cuts. Yet even before House Republicans won power in the midterm elections, they were promising to hold the debt limit hostage unless Biden and Democrats would agree to huge spending cuts.",

            "content": "Raye has revealed she still suffers from panic attacks and post traumatic stress disorder from being sexually assaulted.\n\nThe singer, 25, previously shared her experience with being assaulted by a music producer who forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.\n\nSpeaking to Cosmopolitan, Raye discussed the long-lasting effects of the incident and writing about it on her new album My 21st Century Blues.\n\nShe said: 'When I think about the panic attacks, the PTSD...you realise that someone's actions become your burden to carry, and there is nowhere you can put it other than a therapy session.\n\n'That's so isolating. It's not the kind of thing you can bring to the surface easily. You can't hang out with a bunch of friends and be like, 'So guys, do you want to talk about rape today? That's been on my mind a lot!'\n\n'That song [Ice Cream Man] is me bringing it to the surface.'\n\nRaye added that she thinks the music industry can leave young women vulnerable and artists fear being blacklisted for saying the wrong thing.\n\nShe said: 'Every girl I know in this industry has some sort of story to tell me. The studio is such a vulnerable space.\n\n'And if you say something, you create an enemy who will spread rumours or blacklist you – and you need those connections to open doors for yourself.\n\n'Even though the people decide very much what's consumed on the outside, inside, the music industry is still very much a gatekept society.'\n\nRaye, who came on the scene for her vocal on hits like By Your Side and You Don't Know Me, felt it was difficult to build the narrative she wanted previously in her career:\n\nShe said: 'I was being asked to write with some of the most incredible artists in the world. Meanwhile, I'm not taken seriously enough to govern and navigate my own success.\n\n'What more did I have to do to prove myself? I did everything I could, and I still wasn't enough.\n\n'Releasing music that says nothing means nothing...that was never why I decided to become an artist in the first place. I found myself building a narrative I never wanted to build.'\n\nOn her focus moving forwards, Raye added: 'I have to find peace. I have to see the glass as half-full. Music is my way of being loud and owning the narrative.\n\n'I've taken control on a very personal level to reach out to a lot of the people who have hurt me or crossed a line – I've confronted it head on.'\n\nThe star, who is mixed race, previously joined musicians Alexandra Burke, Nao and Keisha Buchanan for Leigh-Anne Pinnock's BBC documentary, Leigh-Anne: Race, Pop & Power:\n\nDiscussing the documentary, she said: 'Having the chance to unite with women who share the same sort of struggle was so powerful. Men will roll their eyes, but it really is so much harder as a woman.\n\n'Then you bring race into it, and it's just a completely different game entirely. The darker your skin, the tougher it is.\n\n'We have miles and miles to go, even in the balance of output – if you look at an average UK Top 40, what's the ratio of Black women?'\n\nRaye also discussed her dating life, saying the phrase she'd have on her dating profile would be: 'Unavailable, unless you're my husband.'\n\nShe added: 'That's what it would read…I'm not here for any wishy-washy candidates…but it's really nice actually because I feel in control, I don't feel lonely, I'm actually great.\n\n'So, if someone wants to come and add to the greatness, by all means…but if not, just leave, no I'm not here for any of that other nonsense!'",

            "description": "Gov. Gavin Newsom has started implementing a new law that allows recently-arrived border crossers to police Americans.",
            "content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has started implementing a new law in the sanctuary state of California that allows recently-arrived border crossers to police American citizens as law enforcement officers with local, county, and state agencies.\n\nLast year, Newsom signed S.B. 960, which only requires that law enforcement officers in the state have a work permit to be employed in the United States — removing residency requirements that mandated law enforcement officers be either American citizens or green card-holders that had at least filed to become naturalized American citizens.\n\nThe new law, which went into effect this month in California, states:\n\nExisting law establishes the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training within the Department of Justice to perform various functions involving the training of peace officers. Existing law requires peace officers in this state to meet specified minimum standards, including, among other requirements, being at least 18 years of age, being of good moral character, as determined by a thorough background investigation, and being either a citizen of the United States or a permanent resident who is eligible for and has applied for citizenship, except as prescribed. [Emphasis added] This bill would provide that those standards shall be interpreted and applied consistent with federal law and regulations, as specified. The bill would remove the provision that requires peace officers to either be a citizen of the United States or be a permanent resident who is eligible for and has applied for citizenship, and would instead require peace officers be legally authorized to work in the United States, and make conforming changes. [Emphasis added]\n\nIn effect, the law allows recently-arrived border crossers — released into the U.S. interior and given work permits by President Joe Biden’s administration — to secure jobs in California as law enforcement officers.\n\nFrom February 2021 to October 2022, Biden’s DHS has released at least 1.4 million border crossers and illegal aliens into American communities — most of which have been given work permits allowing them to stay in the U.S. while awaiting their immigration hearings.\n\nMost recently, Biden announced a plan that blows open the doors to an even more expansive Catch and Release network at the U.S.-Mexico border, where 360,000 more border crossers will be able to get into the U.S. interior by applying for parole.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

            "content": "President Joe Biden's administration has once against blocked South Dakota GOP Gov. Kristi Noem's Independence Day fireworks celebration, drawing another rebuke from former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The best way to celebrate America's Birthday is with fireworks at Mount Rushmore,\" Noem posted Thursday night on Truth Social, sharing a photo of fireworks exploding over the faces of four presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n\"Today, the Biden administration rejected them. Again.\"\n\nThe news drew a response from Trump, who delivered a July 3, 2020 speech at Mount Rushmore the last time fireworks were permitted there. Biden's National Parks Service has denied Noem's requests since.\n\n\"But I made this incredible event happen, and was there to celebrate with the great people of South Dakota, and America,\" Trump posted Thursday night on Truth Social. \"Ridiculous that it is no longer allowed. So great for USA spirit.\"\n\nTrump vowed to bring the event back in July 2025, if he is elected the 47th president of the United States after the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n\"As president, it will soon happen again,\" Trump's post concluded. \"I love Mount Rushmore!\"\n\nTrump — then-president, during the height of the 2020 presidential campaign, the pandemic, and Black Lives Matter riots — delivered an Independence Day eve vow to protect America and Mount Rushmore from \"a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children.\"\n\n\"There could be no better place to celebrate America's Independence than to lead this magnificent, incredible, majestic mountain monument to the greatest Americans who have ever lived,\" Trump said in his speech in South Dakota, at the base of Mount Rushmore.\n\n\"I am here as your president to proclaim before the country and before the world: This monument will never be desecrated; these heroes will never be defaced; their legacy will never, ever be destroyed; their achievements will never be forgotten; and Mount Rushmore will stand forever as an eternal tribute to our forefathers and to our freedom.\"",

            "description": "Recovery from darkest days of crypto winter comes despite lukewarm profit outlook and bond downgrade.",
            "content": "Shares of Coinbase Global have been recovering from their swoon of 2022 this month, as the publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange became the subject of chatter on Wall Street, with conflicting elements of cost cuts and money manager Cathie Wood’s bullishness versus a mix of negative and neutral outlooks from investment-banking analysts and a bond downgrade\n\nThe stock ended Thursday at $47.55, a 9% gain for the day and up from just $33.26 on Friday. The Tuesday announcement that the exchange would be firing about 20% of its workforce on Tuesday seems to have been taken as a positive development by investors.\n\nArk Invest’s Cathie Wood has been bullish on the stock over the last week, adding over $7 million worth of its shares to her funds. However, major banks and bond rater Standard & Poor’s did not have quite the same sentiments.\n\nBank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg was among the naysayers on Wall Street, downgrading the exchange to underperform from neutral, cutting the price target to $35 from $50.\n\nA note from Jefferies, which has a hold rating on the stock, said “Coinbase will be acutely pressured in the near term.” This is due to retail customers trading less in a bear market. However, due to the crypto exchanges healthy balance sheet and being a publicly traded company, it believes the company will survive the crypto winter.\n\nOn Thursday, Standard & Poor’s trimmed its rating on the company’s issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings on Coinbase to BB- from BB, forecasting the crypto exchange’s profitability will remain under pressure in 2023 despite the cost-cutting efforts and an expected boost to interest income.\n\nThe November collapse of the FTX empire has reduced the digital-assets industry’s credibility, S&P said, agreeing with Jefferies that this would weigh on trading, which represents about 80% of Coinbase’s revenue.\n\nThere was some positive news, however, Coinbase has an agreement with Circle, the provider of USD Coin (USDC ), that generates income from U.S. Treasuries the exchange holds to back the stablecoin. Those yields are rising as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy. Coinbase also generates interest income on about $5 billion of cash it holds and on traditional currencies held in customer accounts, S&P said.\n\nAssuming trading remains depressed and even with the beneficial effects of cost cuts and rising interest rates, S&P projects “very small” positive profit based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That would follow negative Ebitda the company has forecast for 2022, with a maximum loss of $500 million.\n\nThe company had about $3.4 billion of outstanding notes at the end of Q3, according to its latest quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Its 3.375% notes due in October 2028 edged up to 60 cents on the dollar from 59.116 on Wednesday. That trimmed the yield to 13.7% from 14%, according to industry regulator Finra.\n\nStill, the bonds yielded 4.69% a year ago and the stock traded at $234.70 in the waning days of the latest crypto bull market.\n\nElsewhere in the digital-assets sphere, Bitcoin up 7% for the day and trading around $18,800 while ether’s price reached $1,425, up 6%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe value of all crypto currencies breached the $900 billion barrier, rising to $904.7 billion late in the day after reaching a December nadir of $790.4 billion, data from CoinMarketCap shows. Late in 2021, the market was worth almost $3 trillion.",

On Thursday, Standard & Poor’s trimmed its rating on the company’s issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings on Coinbase to BB- from BB, forecasting the crypto exchange’s profitability will remain under pressure in 2023 despite the cost-cutting efforts and an expected boost to interest income. Coinbase also generates interest income on about $5 billion of cash it holds and on traditional currencies held in customer accounts, S&P said. \n\nAssuming trading remains depressed and even with the beneficial effects of cost cuts and rising interest rates, S&P projects “very small” positive profit based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.",

Mr Hill said later in the afternoon that three additional deaths had been confirmed. Rescue efforts to free people trapped in homes along Autauga County Road 68 were ongoing Thursday afternoon. Alabama Gov.

            "content": "Olivia Rodrigo flashed her megawatt smile as she made her way to a New York City recording studio on Thursday.\n\nThe 19-year-old pop star was dressed casually in faded jeans, Converse Chuck Taylor sneakers, and a black leather jacket.\n\nThe three-time Grammy winner also had a pair of silver-toned headphones around her neck.\n\nHer hip-length brunette hair was arranged in a center part as the locks fell over one side of her chest.\n\nRodrigo, who shot to fame with the release of her debut singer Driver's License two years ago, was bare faced as she showed off her clear complexion.\n\nFlaunting her beauty, the singer-songwriter used a light gloss and very subtle, winged black eyeliner.\n\nThe songstress carried her phone in her left hand, flashing various rings on her fingers.\n\nShe appeared to be in good spirits during the cloudy and damp Big Apple outing as bodyguard followed closely behind her.\n\nThe star kept a relatively low profile as she headed inside the studio, where she likely was going to work on her forthcoming sophomore album.\n\nLast month Olivia assured fans she will be releasing new music in 2023 following the massive success of her debut album Sour, which earned her three Grammy Awards.\n\nThe recording artist confirmed the exciting news in a 'thank you' video to fans following the release of her Spotify Wrapped in December.\n\n'I just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to my music this year,' gushed the star, who boasts over 35 million monthly listeners on the music streaming platform.\n\n'I really, truly couldn't be more grateful and I am so excited for next year, and all of the new things and new music that 2023 will bring,' she teased.\n\nDespite coming out in 2021, Sour was the third-most streamed album globally in 2022, according to Variety.\n\nShe was beat out by Bad Bunny's Un Verano Sin Ti and Harry Styles' Harry's House, and her project was also the fifth-most streamed album in the United States.\n\nNearly a year ago Olivia opened up about the new album in an interview with Billboard.\n\nAt the time she noted, 'I have a title for my next album and a few songs.\n\n'It's really exciting to think about the next world that's coming up for me. I just love writing songs. I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself. [I want to] just sort of explore and have fun right now.'",

            "content": "The deck normally doesn’t fill to the brim for a regular season contest. But every year, Westfield and Christian Brothers take to the pool in what is generally expected to be the fastest and most intense meet prior to the playoffs.\n\nThe fans at the YMCA of Westfield - loud and engaged for the entire event - weren’t disappointed on Thursday as two of the top boys teams in New Jersey kept it close before Westfield won the final four events to scathe past the Colts, 94-76. The Westfield girls squad, ranked No. 1 in the NJ.com Top 20, added to the Blue Devils’ flare with a 115-55 victory over Trinity Hall.\n\n“This is always a big meet for Westfield. We take a lot of pride in this matchup and it may not be for a championship or anything, but this is a great way to gear up for the remainder of the season in terms of facing the best competition,” Westfield sophomore Owen Waibel said.\n\nWith five races remaining, the two titans were tied at three separate points. Late in the game, No. 2 Christian Brothers took a 58-52 lead following a 1-2-3 finish from Jack Butler, Kiernan Leary and Nick Volkov in the 500 freestyle.\n\nThe No. 4 Blue Devils anticipated a struggle in the 500 and maintained the confidence that their swimmers would rebound in front of the home crowd.\n\n“We knew they had depth in the 500. We moved some guys around to other events where we’d swim more effectively,” Westfield boys head coach Jeff Knight said.\n\n“We had a plan. We knew where our strengths and weaknesses were going to be but we stuck to what we prepared for and it all came together the way we wanted,” Waibel added.\n\nThe 200 freestyle relay brought it back to a fourth tie following Westfield’s 1-3-6 finish that saw a victory (1:27.23) from Logan Swenson, Leo Mangiamele, Dylan Altman and Owen Waibel. Waibel scorched to a 20.57 timestamp as the anchor, beating his earlier 20.87 time in the 50 freestyle that won the race over All-State sensation Luke Condon.\n\nColin Kavanagh (51.81 - 100 backstroke) and Dylan Lagrimas (1:02.34 - 100 breaststroke) paced Westfield (6-0) to a pair of wins in the final individual events to seal the win with an 84-72 lead.\n\nWaibel, Swenson, Danny Pierce and Kavanagh then closed it out in the 400 freestyle relay with a 3:13.82 time to give Westfield their second consecutive victory over CBA.\n\n“CBA is a phenomenal team with a ton of depth, so it’s an honor to go up against a group like that. We have nothing but respect for them. It’s a long-standing tradition to swim each other during the season because neither of us will hide from the best teams,” Knight said. “No trophies were given out today but we take it as an opportunity to grow and achieve even more ambitious goals.”\n\n“Regardless of the year, this is a meet both sides always look forward to. We’ll never see each other in the postseason, so it’s almost like a championship-style meet in the middle of the season. This is a good check-in for us. I thought we fought hard,” Christian Brothers head coach Alex Fitton said.\n\nCBA (5-1) came out with a little extra fire in the first three events. The 200 medley relay saw a few nail-biting overtakes from both sides with CBA ultimately grabbing the late win from Condon, Conor Doogan, Bryce Wilkens and Max Maycher at 1:36.37 - just 0.62 seconds quicker than Westfield.\n\nEvan Whitaker was trailing in the ensuing 200 freestyle race but squeezed out the 0.20-second win at 1:44.79. Then in the 200 individual medley - which was won by Kavanagh at 1:56.45 - Alex Ruckel-Bekefi notched a second-place finish despite falling behind midway through.\n\n“We put a lot of young guys in high-pressure situations today, and on purpose. We need them to understand what being in an environment like this feels like under pressure. I’m so proud of them, they never gave up despite knowing Westfield would come out swinging,” Fitton said.\n\nThe battle of the day was between Waibel and Condon. Arguably the two best sprint swimmers in New Jersey, the two superstars squared off in the 50 and 100 free that saw wins by Waibel each time.\n\n“Luke is such a great competitor. I knew it was going to be a big matchup and swimming at this level pushes me to help my team. We all contributed, though and that’s why we came out on top in the end,” Waibel said.\n\n“They are two of the top swimmers in the state. They’ve seen each other at other events and Owen’s never going to take a swimmer like Luke for granted. They bring out the very best in each other,” Knight said.\n\n“It’s rare for Luke to not win those events. I know they’re familiar with each other in the club scene and it was two great battles between guys who weren’t going to run from each other,” Fitton added.\n\nFor the Westfield girls team, the Blue Devils improved to 7-0 behind 10 first-place finishes to extend the unit’s winning streak to 24 in dual meets.\n\nClare Logan, Emily Constable and Abby Bebel led the way with four wins apiece.\n\nLogan clocked out at 1:53.25 in the 200 free and 51.30 in the 100 free to help pace the top-ranked Blue Devils in her individual events. Constable cruised to a 2:10.95 in the 200 IM and a 1:03.40 in the 100 breast.\n\nBebel finished the 50 free at 25.05 and the 100 fly at 58.15.\n\n“We’re fortunate to have a lot of fast swimmers. They always keep their focus and try to get faster. Today was another step in the right direction,” Westfield girls head coach Steve Whittington said.\n\nConstable and Bebel, who were joined by Lauren Lane and Brooke McAndrew in the 200 MR, got the Blue Devils on the right foot to begin the day at 1:48.35 while also tallying a second-place finish from Isabelle Giaccobe, Clara Yu, Emily Kapuscinski and Katherine Li.\n\nWestfield produced four races with a first and second-place nod to outlast Trinity Hall, who lost for the first time this winter.\n\n“I think our depth is something we can always improve on. What makes a team valuable is how the outside lanes swim and we’re going to need them in the long run,” Whittington said.\n\nIn the remaining relays, Emily Constable, Katherine Li, Abby Bebel and Clare Logan fired off a 1:39.43 in the 200 FR while McAndrew, Chloe Yu, Lauren Lane and Logan went for a 3:39.04 stroll in the 400 FR.\n\nLane also cranked to a win in the 100 back at at 1:00.96.\n\nTrinity Hall scooped the win in the 500 freestyle from McLane Gmelich (5:15.62), who also finished second in the 200 free at 1:56.66.\n\nThe N.J.

We moved some guys around to other events where we’d swim more effectively,” Westfield boys head coach Jeff Knight said. \n\nThe 200 freestyle relay brought it back to a fourth tie following Westfield’s 1-3-6 finish that saw a victory (1:27.23) from Logan Swenson, Leo Mangiamele, Dylan Altman and Owen Waibel. Waibel scorched to a 20.57 timestamp as the anchor, beating his earlier 20.87 time in the 50 freestyle that won the race over All-State sensation Luke Condon.\n\nColin Kavanagh (51.81 - 100 backstroke) and Dylan Lagrimas (1:02.34 - 100 breaststroke) paced Westfield (6-0) to a pair of wins in the final individual events to seal the win with an 84-72 lead.\n\nWaibel, Swenson, Danny Pierce and Kavanagh then closed it out in the 400 freestyle relay with a 3:13.82 time to give Westfield their second consecutive victory over CBA.\n\n“CBA is a phenomenal team with a ton of depth, so it’s an honor to go up against a group like that.",

            "content": "Suki Waterhouse opted for a laid-back look prior to kicking off her US tour at the Observatory in Santa Ana, California, on Tuesday.\n\nThe model-turned-singer, 31, braved the rainy weather in a black graphic hoodie and matching leather pants as well as dark sneakers.\n\nThe beauty — who stunned at the Dior menswear show in Giza with boyfriend Robert Pattinson last month — was seen greeting fans outside and grabbing a bite to eat with her band members, before performing a sound-check at the venue.\n\nHer 2023 tour consists of 25 concerts across 5 countries including US, Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Germany.\n\nThe runway sensation wore her blond tresses cascading down in a straight style, with her bangs framing her face.\n\nShe appeared to go fresh-faced for the day, letting her natural beauty shine through. The star later bundled up in a blue puffer vest while grabbing coffee with a friend.\n\nThe star also took to her Instagram to share some backstage snaps of herself.\n\nShe looked incredible in a sheer black top that showed off her black bra, which she paired with a mini skirt and a colorful jacket with a feather trim sleeve.\n\nSuki finalized her look with a bright red lipstick. 'Coolest band in the world,' she captioned the snap.\n\nSuki has recently released her 10-track debut album I Can't Let Go but admitted she was unsure about the project for a long time.\n\nShe told Variety: 'It was something that I desperately wanted to do. For probably the last four years as I was putting out these singles, I guess I was testing my own courage and whether or not people would like it.'\n\n'I was definitely slow, just putting out one a year is not the best way to run your music business… I've been writing it for a long time, but it's like the reality of it happening, I was unsure about. And then I just decided to do it.'\n\nAlthough she's been happily dating Pattinson, 35, for the past few years, she revealed that album opener Moves was written during a time in her life when she was 'so over being in love'.\n\nShe explained: 'Like it's so tiring, it's so exhausting. I'd been alone for a few years and I was quite walled off... I was thinking about how I wanted to do a song that Thelma and Louise would be listening to, that would be on the tape track as they drive off the mountain.'\n\nPattinson did not appear to be present at her US gig. Suki has been dating the Twilight star since 2018, and the two have been private about their love.\n\n'If you let people in, it devalues what love is. If a stranger on the street asked you about your relationship, you’d think it extremely rude,' Robert told The Sunday Times in 2019.\n\nThe Tenet actor was previously in high-profile romances with his Twilight co-star Kristen Stewart and singer FKA twigs.\n\nMeanwhile Suki was in a relationship with Bradley Cooper for two years and briefly dated James Marsden.",

            "description": "Microsoft revealed a power-saving feature for its Xbox console that it says will help gamers fight climate change. It’s a sign of things to come for Big Tech.",
            "content": "Republicans’ contrived outrage over the Biden administration’s promotion of climate-friendly stoves has me thinking about how unprepared they are for the realities of our high-tech future.\n\nBecause climate-conscious appliances and devices aren’t going anywhere.\n\nHumans’ continued obsession with technology — whether that’s stoves or blockchain platforms to trade goods or high-powered game consoles — is terrible for the environment.\n\nMerely producing these things often requires mining for resources, as well as an assembly process that leaves a major carbon footprint. But the energy to run these things, multiplied across the millions of people who use them, really adds up.\n\nThat’s why I was intrigued by this article in Ars Technica, about Microsoft’s recently announced changes to its Xbox gaming console that the company says will make it more eco-friendly.\n\nThe changes, Microsoft said Wednesday, “will create opportunities for our collective community of gamers to make choices to reduce environmental impact while gaming.”\n\nEssentially, the company is rolling out a power-saving feature that will allow a console linked to the internet to read local energy consumption data provided by the user’s nearest power grid. The console then uses that data to schedule Xbox updates and maintenance for times when the most renewable energy is available.\n\nMicrosoft claims this “decreases fossil fuel dependency and CO2 emissions” and makes Xbox the first “carbon-aware” gaming console. Now you can fight climate change while updating “Elden Ring” or the game of your choice.\n\nI should add the caveat that while it’s great that Microsoft seems to be embracing the “green gaming” movement by helping people take climate measures, Microsoft’s data centers still require a lot of power to run. This isn’t Greenpeace we’re talking about here.\n\nThat said, it’s encouraging to me that gamers are being ushered into the fight against climate change this way. Tech enthusiasts of all sorts will have to take note and follow suit. Embrace climate consciousness — don’t cower from it like Republicans evidently wish you would. It’s the only way lofty dreams of a high-tech world can be realized without Earth literally going up in flames.",

The console then uses that data to schedule Xbox updates and maintenance for times when the most renewable energy is available.\n\nMicrosoft claims this “decreases fossil fuel dependency and CO2 emissions” and makes Xbox the first “carbon-aware” gaming console. Now you can fight climate change while updating “Elden Ring” or the game of your choice.\n\nI should add the caveat that while it’s great that Microsoft seems to be embracing the “green gaming” movement by helping people take climate measures, Microsoft’s data centers still require a lot of power to run.",

            "content": "Purdue University Northwest student Theodore Mantis of Schererville said he was proud of his Mexican heritage as a youth when he first entered middle school.\n\nHe was the only Latino in the class for accelerated students, where all his classmates were white. Mantis recalled the first comments a classmate made to him as he sat in his desk waiting for class to begin.\n\n“He said, ‘They must have lowered the standards’,” Mantis recalled.\n\nThe words cut, hanging with him for years and negatively impacting the pride he felt in his heritage until he began college.\n\nHe said what people say matters and young people in college need to know they are free to be who they are.\n\n“This is the time to really represent yourself in the community,” Mantis said to applause.\n\nMantis shared the story Thursday during a discussion on racial inequality at Purdue University Northwest in Hammond that was part of the university’s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day remembrance celebration. More than 75 students and faculty members participated in one of two sessions. The other was on voter suppression.\n\nThe discussions come as the university grapples with calls for the resignation of Chancellor Thomas Keon, who has come under fire since racially insensitive comments he made in a Dec. 10 commencement address when he proceeded to speak as if he were trying speak Chinese after keynote speaker Jim Dedelow talked about a made-up language he created to entertain his new granddaughter.\n\nKeon has apologized for his remarks.\n\nCommunications major Kelia Malone shared the stereotypes she faced as she entered the work world and a young black woman from the South Side of Chicago. She recalled when at a job she held as a teen at a prestigious office one of the partners told her she spoke well. Malone said her coworkers who were not from the Chicago’s south side would not receive the same comments.\n\nShe said people need to move past their perceptions for change to occur.\n\nParticipants were encouraged to open up about their thoughts and experiences regarding. race, inequality, voter suppression and what can be done to make things better in the hour leading up to a keynote speech by professor and author Carol Anderson. Simultaneous sessions took place at the Westville campus. Anderson is the Charles Howard Candler Professor of African American Studies at Emory University and a New York Times best-selling author of “White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide.”\n\nAnderson spoke about the role voter suppression has played in politics and the impact it has had in the African American community since the Civil War. While methods may appear more subtle today, the efforts to suppress the Black vote continue.\n\nAnderson said she knows the fate of democracy looks bleak, but the fight continues.\n\n“The quest for democracy cannot be denied. It won’t be denied,” Anderson said.\n\nPeople will always find ways around the obstacles to put in place representatives that value the people they represent, she said.\n\n“In the struggle for democracy, you are seeing the struggle for community,” Anderson said.\n\n“Voter suppression is designed to make you think it’s futile, it’s hopeless. That’s not true. What you do is fight against it. Get folks to engage. That civic engagement is absolutely essential in fighting voter suppression.”",

            "description": "Lisa Marie Presley is in critical condition after suffering cardiac arrest on Thursday, January 12th, and being rushed to the hospital.",
            "content": "Lisa Marie Presley’s condition is not looking good.\n\nThe only child of the late-Elvis Presley was rushed to the hospital on January 12th after suffering cardiac arrest in her home.\n\nEmergency personnel was able to resuscitate Lisa Marie before taking her to the hospital, but she has not regained consciousness.\n\nLisa Marie’s Presley’s Outlook Is Looking Very Grim\n\nAccording to reports, emergency personnel performed CPR on the star and she was given epinephrine; however, that doesn’t seem to be enough.\n\nShe is currently in “critical” condition. LMP was put into an induced coma and given a temporary pacemaker according to reports.\n\nLisa Marie remains in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at West Hills Hospital and Medical Center. Her mother, Priscilla Presley, was spotted going to the hospital following the shocking and tragic news.\n\nThe 77-year-old was seen walking hurriedly into the hospital while talking to an unidentified male.\n\nShe wore an all-dark attire along with a black face mask. Just two days ago, Lisa Marie and Priscilla attended the 80th Golden Globes alongside Austin Butler. Butler portrayed Elvis in Baz Lurhmann’s “Elvis.”\n\nHe took home the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture for his portrayal of “The King of Rock N’ Roll.”\n\nHe thanked the Presley family for their love and support.\n\n“Thank you guys for opening your hearts, your memories, your home to me. Lisa Marie, Priscilla, I love you forever,” Butler said.\n\nAt this point in the speech, Lisa Marie crossed her hands, put them over her heart, and patted her chest.\n\nButler concluded his GG speech by thanking Elvis himself.\n\n“Lastly, Elvis Presley himself. You were an icon and a rebel and I love you so much,” he said.\n\nThe Blast recently reported her looking a little shaky while walking with Butler at the Globes.\n\nElvis’ daughter was in high gear all night. The importance and impact of the night might have progressed her cardiac arrest.\n\nA new video of LMP at the Globes is making the rounds shows the singer needing assistance to get down a small set of steps ahead of the show.\n\nPrior to entering the Beverly Hilton Hotel, Lisa Marie was seen being escorted by Butler from the Entertainment Tonight interview space to another spot on the carpet.\n\nHe made sure to have his hand on her back.\n\nAnother video of Lisa Marie hours after the broadcast, after the red carpet, showed similar shakes. It’s after Butler’s big win and Presley is speaking about what the movie has meant to her but even in this video she doesn’t seem all there. Her speech is slow, and her body language seems off.\n\nIt could be the high of the night because Lisa has not shared any ailments with her fans in the past few years which would indicate that a heart attack or behavior like this was on the horizon for her.\n\nEerily enough, Elvis reportedly died of a heart attack on August 16, 1977.\n\nHe passed away in his Memphis, TN. mansion better known as “Graceland.”\n\nElvis was only 42 years old at the time of his death, which was ruled a heart attack due to his drug and substance abuse.\n\nHe had an addiction to prescription barbiturates.",

            "title": "Coming soon for Ed Donatell, Vikings defensive coordinator: a playoff win or a pink slip",
            "description": "It's likely Vikings defensive coordinator Ed Donatell is coaching for his job on Sunday, but his comments Thursday were relaxed and confident.",
            "content": "Winning a Super Bowl bolsters a coordinator's legacy and earning power. Win it all, and you immediately become a head coaching candidate, perhaps the next Bill Belichick or Kevin O'Connell.\n\nThis postseason will work a little differently than that for defensive coordinator Ed Donatell. If the Vikings win the championship, he will have marginally improved his chances of keeping his job.\n\nE_ _'onatell — the D's will be withheld until he earns them back — holds a vital position on a team that won 13 games. It is a measure of the Vikings' thrilling yet pockmarked season that they enter the playoffs with a coordinator needing to perform miracles to remain employed.\n\nWhich is why Donatell's weekly news conference, held on Thursday morning, sounded so odd. Donatell is usually cautious. While previewing the Vikings' playoff game against the New York Giants on Sunday, he seemed chipper. Almost cocky.\n\n\"It's our time to shine,'' he said.\n\nHe also said: \"I think you'll like the way we play,'' as if he were selling a cheap suit.\n\nThe Vikings' defense finished the season ranked 31st overall, 31st against the pass and 20th against the run.\n\nDonatell noted that the Vikings have improved situationally late in the season. They rank 12th in preventing third-down conversions. They are tied for eighth in turnovers forced, and many of those turnovers have led directly to victories.\n\n\"We've been put in a lot of big moments, and it's hardened us,'' he said.\n\nLast time they faced the Giants, the Vikings' defense resembled unrefrigerated margarine.\n\nDaniel Jones passed for 334 yards, only the second time this season he reached 300. Richie James, a reserve receiver, set season bests with eight catches and 90 receiving yards. Isaiah Hodgins set season bests with eight catches for 89 yards and scored a touchdown.\n\nRunning back Saquon Barkley averaged 6 yards a carry, produced 133 yards from scrimmage and scored. The Giants outgained a superior Vikings offense, 445 yards to 353, and the Vikings needed 17 fourth-quarter points, including a 61-yard last-second field goal by Greg Joseph, to win, 27-24.\n\nMonday, Vikings linebacker Eric Kendricks, typically pleasant in conversation, was asked about his team's defensive statistics in two different ways. His expression changed and he twice said something like, \"If we hold the other team to fewer points than we score, we win,'' then turned away.\n\nKendricks is emblematic of this defense. He is one of many intelligent and accomplished veteran players on a unit that remains in the midst of statistical collapse.\n\nThe Vikings ranked first in the league in yards allowed in 2017. Their yearly rankings since then: fourth, 14th, 27th, 30th and 31st.\n\nMike Zimmer was fired, in part, because he was responsible for the defense. Donatell's defense was worse, at least in terms of gross (and grotesque) yardage.\n\nHow does a team with Harrison Smith, Patrick Peterson, Za'Darius Smith, Kendricks, Danielle Hunter, Dalvin Tomlinson and Harrison Phillips get routinely shredded?\n\nThere is more than one answer.\n\nThey were asked to adjust to not only a new defensive coordinator but a new scheme, the 3-4.\n\nMany of the Vikings' best defenders have dealt with significant injuries and are slower than they were in their prime.\n\nThe new regime spent their top two draft picks on defensive backs, Lewis Cine and Andrew Booth, who have not contributed because of injuries.\n\nDonatell has generally played a passive defense, which has led to easy yards for opponents.\n\nDonatell has two things going for him: His defense isn't much worse than last year's, and his defense has made winning plays, often near the goal line.\n\nEarlier this season, I asked Harrison Smith if yardage statistics mattered when his team was winning. \"Yeah,'' he said with a smile. \"For vanity.''\n\nThis defense hasn't been much of a vanity project for Donatell. Maybe he's cheerful because he knows that, come Sunday night, he will either have added a playoff victory to his résumé, or he won't have to spend the rest of this winter in Minnesota.",

            "content": "In the latest edition of Variety Doc Dreams presented by National Geographic, director Peter Berg details the year-long process of filming the North Community High School football team in Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Berg and his crew expected an emotionally-charged shoot, given the somewhat operatic ups and downs the team’s football season, coached by members of the Minneapolis Police Department amid rising tensions in the city — and across the globe.\n\n“I’m not coming in here with an agenda other than, ‘I believe something kind of special and beautiful is happening in this community,” Berg said, recounting his early conversations with the North High team, coaches and their families. “I’m coming here under the thesis that there’s a special relationship between these coach-cops and these kids and their families.”\n\nBut what Berg could not predict, nor would’ve dared to imagine, was the death of one of their lead subjects during production. In Feb. 2021, North High’s star quarterback, 15-year-old Deshaun Hill Jr. was shot and killed. Just days before his death, they’d filmed a scene with Hill on a date with his girlfriend. The Hill had been murdered was unimaginable.\n\n“People get killed in this country every single day, young people do. We just don’t hear about it, or we hear about it for a second, and it’s just, ‘Oh, that’s horrible,’ and we move on. It’s very hard to live in that and to feel it,” Berg said. “It was very painful for all of us involved in this, it wrecked us.”\n\nAt the time of Hill’s murder, the crew had about two more weeks of production, so Berg urged the crew to finish the project in Hill’s honor. With much of his playing career and potential captured on camera, the documentary was something for his family to cherish.\n\n“You get tunnel vision. I don’t really care anymore whether it makes money for Showtime, whether so-and-so likes it, whether so-and-so hates it,” Berg said of getting back to work with the crew. “Now, suddenly it’s all about really, five people, Deshaun Hill’s immediate family, particularly his mother.”\n\nBefore the locking the docuseries, Berg assembled Hill’s family and all the players, coaches and parents involved in the project to view an early cut.\n\n“When we showed her the film, and I saw tears and laughter and smiles at the end and she said, ‘Yes, please do this,’ that was pretty much everything for me,” Berg said. “Boys in Blue” is currently available to watch on Showtime.",

            "description": "Coughlin’s long and winding coaching adventure reached the pinnacle. Daboll’s long and winding coaching adventure is on the way.",
            "content": "One of the reasons Brian Daboll has been such a resounding success and taken the Giants to the playoffs in his first season as an NFL head coach is that he has also been a failure.\n\nHis climb through the ranks was not steady and direct. He rose. He fell. He put down roots only to have them yanked out. He was promoted for jobs well done and replaced when the job was not done.\n\nDaboll at age 47 is where he is, days away from the first postseason appearance for the Giants after five barren years, because when the Giants came calling, he was ready, not only to accept the position, but to actually thrive in it. His previous 25 years in the profession — 21 in the NFL — steeled and sharpened him for the demands of a role that can take those who fill it in diabolically different directions.\n\nTake it from one who knows.\n\n“There’s no question about it, there’s things you have to go through,’ Tom Coughlin said.\n\nSo says the coach who most recently brought a Lombardi Trophy to the glass-enclosed showcase in the lobby of the Giants’ facility, He actually added two of them to the display. Coughlin appreciates the way Daboll got here.\n\nDaboll thought he was ready before this. As it turns out, his big chance came at precisely the right time.\n\n“I would tell you, I always thought I would be ready, whenever that was,’’ Daboll told The Post this week during a brief break from his playoff preparation, “and I’m so thankful that I didn’t, because I wasn’t.’’\n\nCoughlin set a goal for himself to be a head coach at a high-level college program or the NFL by the time he was 45. He was no wunderkind skyrocketing upward. Coughlin spent 15 years in the college game before he made it to the NFL with the Eagles in 1984 as a wide receivers coach. That lasted two years before Marion Campbell was fired and Coughlin had to move. His stay with the Packers lasted only two years, as Forrest Gregg left Green Bay to become the head coach at SMU.\n\nCoughlin was on the coaching carousel, spinning the way so many of these assistants do, hanging on, enduring a dizzying ride. It is no wonder Wink Martindale, the grizzled 59-year-old Giants defensive coordinator with head-coach aspirations of his own, says, “In coaching, we’re gypsies anyway.’’\n\nAfter three years (and one Super Bowl triumph) working with receivers for Bill Parcells and the Giants, Coughlin finally made it, hired as the head coach at Boston College — at age 45.\n\n“You learn really fast about your profession and it’s not all glamor,’’ Coughlin, now 76, told The Post, “and how difficult it is. You go home and tell your wife what the situation really is. You pay a price. There is a maturation process, I believe.’’\n\nDaboll was a full participant in his own maturation process.\n\n“Obviously he’s paid his dues,’’ Coughlin said. “He’s a guy that has won and has that aura about him. Brian has been in some great situations. He coached with [Bill] Belichick for what, 12 years? And then he had this really nice thing going in Buffalo. Those are wonderful experiences.’’\n\nSome of these experiences were indeed wonderful, some were less so.\n\nDaboll went through a stretch of eight years where he was with six different NFL teams. He was with the Jets when they fired Eric Mangini. Two years later, Daboll was with the Browns when they fired Eric Mangini (not a misprint). He was with the Dolphins for one year when they fired Tony Sparano. He was with the Chiefs for one year when they fired Romeo Crennel. He had been an offensive coordinator for three different NFL teams but when he returned to Belichick and the Patriots in 2013, he was bumped down to tight ends coach. One season (2017) back in college at Alabama, winning a national championship as Nick Saban’s offensive coordinator, redirected Daboll’s arrow pointing in an upward direction.\n\n“It took 20-plus years,’’ Daboll said. “Some guys are in the league for three and get an opportunity. I think every journey’s different, mine certainly was a longer one. I’m still fairly young but it certainly took a long time.’’\n\nThese are lessons that the 30-something hotshot coordinators in demand in the most recent NFL hiring cycles do not possess. Lessons that grant perspective, wisdom and a sense of how to handle whatever is thrown at them.\n\n“I feel very comfortable in my own skin, if that makes sense, and I don’t know if I could say that 10 years ago, or 15 years ago,’’ Daboll said.\n\nLike Coughlin, Daboll also set a goal for when he wanted to be an NFL head coach.\n\n“It was before 45, I’ll tell you that,’’ he said. “It was before 40.’’\n\nHe did not attain his goal in the time he established for himself. It is no wonder when Daboll speaks, often, of the NFL being “humbling’’ it is because he has been humbled while working in it.\n\nHis work with Josh Allen and the Bills’ offense got Daboll in the door but he kept getting ushered out. He went through seven interviews the past three years for head-coach positions — including the Jets’ job that went to Robert Saleh.\n\n“You put your best foot forward in those interviews and unfortunately I didn’t get any of ’em,’’ Daboll said. “After you do so many of ’em and you get the call, ‘Hey, wish you luck but we went in a different direction,’ you definitely can get discouraged by it.\n\n“I’m not gonna lie to you, sure, when you get told, ‘No,’ you’re definitely like, ‘Damn, is this ever gonna happen?’ I’m not the oldest guy but I’m not the youngest guy either, the way this league has been going.’’\n\nWhen Daboll would “bitch and moan’’ his wife, Beth, would scold him that he needed to keep his feet where they were supposed to be, do the best job possible wherever he was and if it happened, it happened.\n\nCoughlin after three seasons at Boston College became the first head coach of the fledgling Jacksonville Jaguars. When he arrived to lead the Giants in 2004, Coughlin brought with him a foundation steeped in success and also a rigidity that needed to be softened. When he did add flexibility into his demeanor, he connected on a more personal level with his players and won Super Bowls after the 2007 and 2011 seasons.\n\n“You’ve got to learn about dealing with people,’’ Coughlin said. “You’ve got to have spent a certain amount of time in the classroom with the pro player, with the college player, on a level of trying to make them understand what you believe in and what you think is something that will help them on an individual basis. You’ve got to spend that elbow-grease time. That’s a part of it, too.’’\n\nIt took Daboll — 9-7-1 with a Giants team not long ago thought to be one of the worst in the league — time to realize he was not running out of time.\n\n“I’m as thankful — probably more thankful — for the failures than even the successes,’’ he said. “I just think that’s part of my journey. Got a long way to go, I certainly don’t have all the answers right now. I just think I’m where I’m supposed to be, when I’m supposed to be there.’’\n\nCoughlin’s long and winding coaching adventure reached the pinnacle. Daboll’s long and winding coaching adventure is on the way.",

            "content": "Lizzo showed off her curves in a romantic and sexy lingerie set in her latest Instagram post shared on Thursday.\n\nThe songstress, 34, donned a merlot bra and thong set while dancing in the clip to promote her upcoming Valentine's Day collection for her shapewear brand Yitty.\n\nEarlier this week, she also modeled various thongs from her clothing line and declared it was 'Munch Season' in a sultry video posted to her social media page.\n\nThe three-time Grammy Award-winning artist wrote in the caption of the clip: 'Valentine's Day ... Valentine's Night' and 'new shimmering spotlight from @yitty — in a sexy merlot'.\n\nPosing with her backside cheekily to the camera, she donned a bra and thong set in a dark pink color and a light-reflecting material.\n\nThe flutist - who received eight iHeartRadio Award nominations on Wednesday - curled her long and dark hair in effortless waves, cascading down her back.\n\nTo match the lingerie set, she wore a monochromatic pink makeup look featuring a shimmering smoky eye and sparkly blush.\n\nShe finished off her look with a dark mauve pink lip gloss that also glistened in the light.\n\nAt one point, she lifts her hair to show off the back of the lingerie set and showed off her aptly pink French manicure.\n\nStanding in her bedroom, she danced in front of the camera and showed off the eye-catching lingerie set from her brand.\n\nThe About D*mn Time singer launched her shapewear brand with Fabletics early last year.\n\nOn the inspiration behind the brand name, she told Forbes in March: 'Yitty is a nickname my auntie gave me when I was young.\n\n'She was a full-figured woman and one of the coolest people ever with bold, beautiful energy,' she said. 'I wanted that energy in this brand.'\n\nThe champion for body positivity also said, 'I have spent the entirety of my life trying to change the way that I look or reshape my body as if I had to inflict some sort of pain upon it to fit into an archetype or a standard of beauty.'\n\nShe said she started wearing shapewear in middle school, 'I've been wearing shapewear - tight-pinching corsets and underwear bottoms - for a very long time.\n\n'It was really painful and I really felt that it shouldn't be this way,' she said about reforming the standard of beauty. 'We shouldn't be ashamed of our bodies and we shouldn't have to wear these contraptions to feel beautiful.'",

            "content": "Speaker Kevin McCarthy went on a rant Thursday when asked about the differences between the Trump and Biden document dramas — and rightly so.\n\nThe idea that President Joe Biden’s case is entirely different from ex-President Donald Trump’s is the media’s first line of defense for the current prez. And yes, lots of details differ.\n\nBut, as McCarthy noted, many of them make Biden look worse. The speaker’s demolition of the apples-to-apples critique was a powerful performance, slicing all the issues expertly.\n\nHe rightly pointed to the irony that a guy “on ’60 Minutes’ that was so concerned about President Trump’s documents” now has been revealed to have kept secret documents “for years out in the open in different locations,” none of them secure.\n\nNow to the double standard: “Did he utilize the Justice Department to raid President Trump?” And: “You watched them leak photos of files of President Trump; where’s the photos of President Biden’s documents?”\n\nThat is: “Why would they go after a political opponent that way, why would they leak photos and say all this, why would they go through the former first lady’s clothing, why would they go through his son’s clothing, why would they raid as they did?”\n\nThen came the turnaround: “Prior to an election, they found a sitting president, when he was vice president, with top secret documents — why did they handle that differently? We’re in America, we believe in equal justice. Why did they not even tell America that that transpired?\n\n“How did he sit before ‘60 Minutes’ knowing what he had done, how do we find a second location and he’s shocked by it? Why aren’t you [the press] asking him these questions?\n\n“Why doesn’t he come forward to the American public?”\n\nTo recap: Biden was only ex-vice president when he carried off his secrets — meaning he had zero right to do so. Yet he asked on “60 Minutes” of Trump’s docu-mess, “How could anyone be that irresponsible?”\n\nMeanwhile, Biden’s “explanation” is straight out of the old Steve Martin “I forgot” routine. He says he doesn’t remember any of it, and his lawyers say he shouldn’t say anything — which doesn’t oblige him to stonewall; it’s just an excuse for claiming “I hope to have a chance” to talk about it “soon.”\n\nNor does his lawyers’ claim that it was all “inadvertently misplaced” add up: He wrote a book off this stuff.\n\nAnd sent lawyers to go through the old office. As McCarthy noted, “If you call a lawyer to remove something from your office, you must have known ahead of time.”\n\nAn ironic side note: At least one House Democrat has a novel defense of Biden. Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson reportedly says, “I’m suspicious of the timing of it. . . . Things can be planted on people, places and things . . . and then discovered conveniently.” (View hosts Sunny Hostin and Joy Behar also find the timing suspicious!)\n\nHilarious: “Possibly planted evidence” was also a Trump defense after the Mar-a-Lago raid.\n\nAnyway, Attorney General Merrick Garland’s own Trump precedent has now forced him to name a special counsel to probe Biden’s docu-drama, too. But Garland still won’t name an independent prosecutor for the Biden family foreign-influence-peddling case, which clearly implicates Joe as well as Hunter.\n\nIt’s beyond obvious that Biden took the docs with him after his time as vice president ended, mostly with an eye on using them in writing that book, then later moved them to his UPenn office. (All without registering them with the National Archives, which has been notably quiet in this case, unlike in Trump’s.)\n\nBy the way: Biden surely used a ghostwriter for his book. Gen. David Petraeus faced felony charges (he cut a plea deal) for sharing classified docs with his biographer.\n\nYes, Biden and Trump’s cases differ in endless ways. But the Mar-a-Lago case prompted the media and some in government to amp up the “possible charges” against the ex-prez, producing innovative legal theories that now clearly should apply to the ex-veep-and-current-prez.\n\nWhy don’t they? As McCarthy pointedly noted, this nation is supposed to believe in “equal justice for all.”",

            "description": "Conservative media personality Megyn Kelly is a hot topic following an angry rant about Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, following the release of Prince",
            "content": "Conservative media personality Megyn Kelly is a hot topic following an angry rant about Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, following the release of Prince Harry’s memoir, “Spare.”\n\nKelly made the comments on Jan. 10 during “The Megyn Kelly Show” on SiriusXM.\n\nIn his book, “Spare,” Prince Harry described an incident where his wife made a seemingly innocent comment about Prince William’s wife, Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales.\n\nAccording to Prince Harry, Markle innocently suggested that Middleton may have “baby brain” due to her memory issues following giving birth. The prince wrote that Middleton was offended by the comment and demanded an apology from Markle. She allegedly added that Markle did not know Middleton well enough to comment on changes she might have been experiencing in her body.\n\nThe memoir quotes Middleton, according to E! Online, as having said, “You talked about my hormones. We are not close enough for you to talk about my hormones!”\n\nPrince Harry noted that Markle was confused by the comments and defended herself by saying that was how she talked with her female friends. Prince William reportedly replied that the comment was “rude” and not how things were done in Britain. Meghan allegedly told Prince William to “take your finger out of my face.”\n\nDuring her show, Kelly was seething as she claimed the story proved that Markle was a bully for making Middleton cry with the “baby brain” comment. The 52-year-old former FOX News anchor began her rant by explaining what she believed the Sussexes needed to apologize for.\n\n“Okay, so he needs somebody to give specifics on what they did wrong,” she began. “He needs specifics and only then will he apologize. I got you, Prince Harry. I got your back. Here’s just a couple off the top of my head. All right. Your wife’s a bully.”\n\nKelly went on to remind her audience that the former communications secretary for the duchess and Prince Harry, Jason Knauf, previously claimed Markle was a bully to her staff. Kelly doubled down on the accusations and claimed that Markle was a bully for making Middleton cry.\n\nMarkle claimed in her 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey that Middleton had made her cry prior to her wedding. Markle added that Middleton apologized to her while noting the press reversed the story and claimed Markle was the one who upset Middleton. Prince Harry said the couple left Britain due to the relentless and racist press coverage along with his family’s refusal to defend them. Journalist Danny Baker was fired after he tweeted a picture of the couple’s son depicted as a monkey.\n\nKelly accused Markle of making the palace staff cry as well as Middleton.\n\n“One of the other people that she made cry was Princess Kate. She told Oprah that Kate made her cry, but now we know from your own book, Harry, that it was Meghan calling Kate ‘a baby brain, it’s your baby brain,’ after she gave birth to her third child,” Kelly said.\n\nKelly continued her rant by claiming that Markle had “the nerve” to comment on Middleton’s hormones. She also laid into Markle about the tiara Markle wore at her wedding.\n\n“That’s the kind of story that makes people not like you within the royal family,” said Kelly.\n\nJournalist Soledad O’Brien shared the clip on Twitter with a short and to the point caption, “(This chick is not okay).”\n\nTwitter users also commented on the video and accused Kelly of being bitter and jealous.\n\n“@MegynKellyShow is angry because she’s so jealous of meghan, the Duchess of Sussexs life. Maybe Megyn Kelly should focus on her own marriage and maybe her husband wouldn’t be chasing other women around.”\n\n“That’s why Tamron Hall is thriving with her own show and Megyn Kelly is downgraded to internet troll.”\n\n“If anyone ever forgets just how awful Megyn Kelly is remember she pays her bills with money NBC gives her to stay OFF the air.”",

            "description": "Anthony Monbleau, a felon with a criminal history dating back to 2009, was arrested again on Thursday on theft and breach of bail charges.",
            "content": "Around 2:30 a.m. on Thursday, police were sent to a home in the Gate City for a report of two people trespassing, Det. Lt. Joshua Albert of the criminal investigation division of the police department. “Anthony was identified as a suspect, and it was determined that he had an active arrest warrant for theft from a Nashua retail store,” he said.\n\nMonbleau was charged with theft and criminal trespass. Detectives, Albert said, furthered the investigation and determined Monbleau had two prior convictions for theft-related offenses out of New Hampshire, making the charge a felony case. Since he was out on bail from two days ago, a breach charge was added.\n\nMonbleau faces nine years in prison and fines. He was unable to post bail and was held. He will be arraigned in Hillsborough County Superior Court South. According to superior court records, Monbleau’s criminal history dates back to 2009.\n\nMonbleau was accused of burglary and theft charges, both felonies, in Brookline in July 2009 and pleaded guilty to both charges in January 2011. He was found guilty of violation of probation in July 2012. Monbleau was also charged with fugitive from justice in September 2009, a charge that was dropped later. In October 2010, Monbleau was accused of burglary in Nashua, but the charge was dismissed in August 2011. He was accused of three forgery charges in Hudson and forgery and theft by deception charges in Nashua. He was found guilty on two of the forgery charges while two others were dismissed and the theft charge was nolle prossed.",

            "description": "Here's everything to know about Amazon Prime Video's 'Daisy Jones & The Six' TV show ahead of its March 3, 2023, release date.",
            "content": "Get ready to rock — Daisy Jones & The Six is officially making its way from the page to the screen.\n\nBased on Taylor Jenkins Reid's best-selling novel of the same name, the upcoming limited series will detail the rise and fall of a fictional '70s rock band — loosely inspired by Fleetwood Mac — and its enigmatic frontwoman Daisy Jones.\n\nGiven the book's popularity, it is no surprise that the rights were quickly swooped up by Reese Witherspoon and her production company Hello Sunshine, who have been behind some of the biggest book-to-screen adaptations, including Little Fires Everywhere and Where the Crawdads Sing. Amazon Prime Video announced the team-up with Witherspoon back in 2018, before the book had even hit shelves.\n\n\"As soon as I started reading Daisy Jones & The Six, I immediately fell head over heels in love with it, and I'm thrilled to be bringing it to the screen with Amazon and Jen Salke, whose passionate pursuit of the material spoke volumes,\" the Oscar winner said in a statement at the time.\n\nNow, as its release date approaches, we know a little bit more about the highly anticipated series, including its cast and original Amazon Music soundtrack. With Hello Sunshine at the helm and a star-studded cast, the adaptation is sure to satisfy fans of the book.\n\nFrom the plot to the release date, keep reading for everything to know about Daisy Jones & The Six.\n\nWhat is Daisy Jones & The Six about?\n\nIf Hello Sunshine's past adaptions are any indication, Daisy Jones & The Six will closely follow the source material, which took readers deep into the world of 1970s-era Rock 'n' Roll and centered on The Six's two lead singers, Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne, as well as their ensuing love triangle.\n\nPrime Video's official plot synopsis reads: \"Based on the best-selling novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid, Daisy Jones & The Six is a limited musical-drama series detailing the rise and precipitous fall of a renowned rock band. In 1977, Daisy Jones & The Six were on top of the world. Fronted by two charismatic lead singers — Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne — the band had risen from obscurity to fame. And then, after a sold-out show at Chicago's Soldier Field, they called it quits. Now, decades later, the band members finally agree to reveal the truth. This is the story of how an iconic band imploded at the height of its powers.\"\n\nThe book is uniquely structured as the script of a music documentary, with the band members reflecting on their glory days 20 years later, so it should be interesting to see if the show follows the same format.\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nA star-studded cast has come together to form The Six. Riley Keough (Elvis Presley's granddaughter) stars as Daisy Jones, while The Hunger Games' Sam Claflin is taking on the role of Billy Dunne.\n\nMaking up the rest of the band is Suki Waterhouse as keyboardist Karen Sirko, Will Harrison as lead guitarist Graham Dunne, Sebastian Chacon as drummer Warren Rhodes and Josh Whitehouse as bassist Eddie Roundtree. Timothy Olyphant will also star as the band's manager, Rod Reyes, and Billy's girlfriend, Camila, will be played by Camila Morrone.\n\nSpeaking to PEOPLE in December 2022, Keough compared her character Daisy to another free-spirited musician she knows — her mother, Lisa Marie Presley.\n\n\"My mother is certainly an inspiration to me,\" the actress said, calling Lisa Marie \"a very strong, smart woman.\"\n\n\"I was raised by somebody who did their own thing and didn't really care what other people thought. She was definitely inspirational to me,\" she added.\n\nIs there a trailer for Daisy Jones & The Six?\n\nWhile a full trailer has not been released yet, Amazon did release the first teaser trailer on Dec. 6, 2022, which shows Keough and Claflin suited up as their rockstar characters. The streamer also revealed the series' release date, writing in the video's description, \"Their story will be told. Daisy Jones and the Six takes the stage March 3, 2023.\"\n\nWill there be original music?\n\nDaisy Jones & The Six will not only be a visual delight — filled with tons of 70s nostalgia — but it will also deliver all-new music, reminiscent of the decade, that fans can stream and download on Amazon Music.\n\nSinger-songwriter and guitarist Blake Mills, who has worked with artists such as Fiona Apple, John Legend and Jay-Z, was tasked with creating the soundtrack and bringing Jenkins Reid's fictional discography to life.\n\n\"Create a band, conjure up their sound, what they're writing about, and how they play,\" Mills told Rolling Stone of the project. \"There's an opportunity to subvert and create a guitar personality that could have been present in the Seventies, and wasn't.\"\n\nThe actors had their work cut out for them as well as some of them had no prior music experience.\n\n\"I have to say, I'd never picked up a guitar before I got this part,\" Claflin told Vanity Fair of his experience becoming Billy Dunne. \"And, you know, having read the book, it wasn't overly clear that I was due to be playing because we took some creative freedom and slightly shifted the parts a little bit, meaning that I was going to be playing not lead guitar, thank God, but rhythm guitar. I had to learn how to hold the guitar, how to strum a guitar. I had the biggest journey to go with the singing as well.\"\n\nWhile Keough may be the granddaughter of the King of Rock 'N' Roll, channeling Daisy Jones was no easy feat either.\n\n\"I didn't even know how one gets to be able to sing loud. I went to a vocal coach and I was like, 'They need me to belt.' I sounded so bad that I started crying,\" she said. \"I was like, 'I have to do it.' I'm gonna go to this vocal coach, and he's gonna teach me how to f------ belt, whatever I need to do to get this. It really became about pushing myself to do things I've never done before.\"\n\nWhen will Daisy Jones & The Six be released?\n\nThe series will premiere on Amazon Prime Video on March 3, 2023, with new episodes released every week until March 24.",

Fronted by two charismatic lead singers — Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne — the band had risen from obscurity to fame. Riley Keough (Elvis Presley's granddaughter) stars as Daisy Jones, while The Hunger Games' Sam Claflin is taking on the role of Billy Dunne. \n\nWill there be original music?\n\nDaisy Jones & The Six will not only be a visual delight — filled with tons of 70s nostalgia — but it will also deliver all-new music, reminiscent of the decade, that fans can stream and download on Amazon Music.",

            "content": "Plan the parade: With Josh Allen at quarterback, any objective is achievable. Though he’s thrown 14 interceptions, he’s also shown an ability to carry the Bills on his back. Buffalo is 8-3 when trailing at any juncture of a game this season after going 2-6 last year. The Bills’ three losses have been decided by three points or fewer. The team is also battle-tested in having overcome much adversity in closing out the season winning seven straight and matching a single-season record for victories. The Bills have won despite having their schedule disrupted by two major winter storms, and they rallied to close the season by beating New England following an emotionally draining week following Hamlin’s collapse at Cincinnati.\n\nHold the confetti: Injuries. The O-line is banged up, and the QB situation seems ever-changing. Tagovailoa was among the NFL’s highest-rated passers all season, but he hasn’t been cleared to return to football activities yet after being diagnosed with a concussion and it’s unclear when the Dolphins will see him back on the field. While Thompson did just enough to lead the Dolphins to a playoff-clinching win over the Jets, Miami’s offense, which was waning even with Tagovailoa toward the end of the season, is severely limited without him.",

(AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nKansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes drops back to pass during the first half of an NFL football game against the Las Vegas Raiders Saturday, Jan. 7, 2023, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nPatrick Mahomes is the graybeard of the quarterbacks in the AFC playoffs even though he’s only 27 and wasn’t even born yet when Tom Brady was a freshman at the University of Michigan in 1995.\n\nWith Tua Tagovailoa (concussion) out and Teddy Bridgewater, 30, also hurt, the Miami Dolphins are preparing rookie Skylar Thompson, 25, to start at Buffalo this weekend.\n\nThat would make Mahomes the oldest starting quarterback in the AFC field.\n\nMahomes said he certainly feels as if he’s entered a new phase in which he’s no longer the puerile passer who took the league by storm in 2018 when he threw for 50 touchdowns and was the league MVP in his first season as the Kansas City Chiefs’ starter.\n\n“Yeah, I feel like it’s changed. I have two kids now, I’m married. I’m kind of an old soul, so I am kind of the oldest — I am literally the oldest — quarterback in the AFC,” Mahomes said.\n\n“It speaks to the talent that we have in the AFC and the guys that I’m looking around at are going to be there for the long time. So, I’ll be the old head in the AFC for a while now and I’ll try to use that experience to my advantage.”\n\nBuffalo’s Josh Allen and Cincinnati’s Joe Burrow are both 26. Chargers QB Justin Herbert and Ravens QB Tyler Huntley, who’s filling in for Lamar Jackson (knee), are both 24, and Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence is 23.\n\nNot that he’ll be reclining in a rocking chair, but Mahomes gets to sit out wild-card weekend after the Chiefs earned the top seed in the AFC for the third time in his five seasons as the starter.\n\nIf they win in the divisional round, the Chiefs would host the conference championship game for a record-extending fifth consecutive year so long as the opponent isn’t the Bills (13-3), whose game at Cincinnati was canceled after safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest on Jan 2.\n\nIf the Bills and Chiefs reach the AFC title game, it will be played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The league brokered the neutral site deal because Buffalo could have been the top seed with a victory over the Bengals.\n\nIt all starts Saturday when the Chargers (10-7) visit the Jaguars (9-8) for the playoff debuts of Herbert and Lawrence. On Sunday, the Dolphins (9-8) visit the Bills (13-3) and the Ravens (10-7) visit the Bengals (12-4).\n\n1. KANSAS CITY CHIEFS (14-3). Two Lombardi trophies in four Super Bowl appearances: lost to Packers 35-10 in Super Bowl 1, beat Vikings 23-7 in Super Bowl 4, beat 49ers 31-20 in Super Bowl 54, lost to Buccaneers 31-9 in Super Bowl 55. Last year: No. 2 seed, beat Steelers 42-21 in wild-card round, beat Bills 42-36 (OT) in divisional round, lost to Bengals 27-24 (OT) in AFC championship game. Eighth consecutive trip to the playoffs. Seventh consecutive AFC West title.\n\nPlan the parade: Because of Patrick Mahomes. It’s the same reason as last year and the three years before, all of which ended in the AFC title game or beyond. He has never failed to advance past the divisional round as the full-time starter in Kansas City. Mahomes was better than ever this season despite losing Tyreek Hill in a trade with Miami. He threw for 5,250 yards to break his own franchise record along with a league-best 41 TD throws.\n\nHold the confetti: Turnovers, penalties and special teams. The Chiefs were minus-3 in turnover differential this season, putting them squarely in the bottom half of the league. They also were in the bottom half in penalty yards. And long a strong suit for Kansas City, special teams have been a headache. Skyy Moore and Kadarius Toney have had trouble with fumbles on punt returns and Harrison Butker is a career-worst 18 of 24 on field-goal attempts with three missed PATs.\n\n“We had a lot of close games this year where we had to step up, and guys had to step up, in big moments, and even though it doesn’t make it easy as a fan watching it, I think it shows that we have guys that will compete at the end of the games and make these plays to win football games.” — Mahomes.\n\n2. BUFFALO BILLS (13-3). No Lombardi trophies in four Super Bowl appearances: lost to Giants 20-19 in Super Bowl 25, lost to Washington 37-24 in Super Bowl 26, lost to Cowboys 52-17 in Super Bowl 27, lost to Cowboys 30-13 in Super Bowl 28. Last year: 11-6, No. 3 seed, beat Patriots 47-17 in wild-card round, lost to Chiefs 42-36 (OT) in divisional round. Third straight AFC East title.\n\nPlan the parade: With Josh Allen at quarterback, any objective is achievable. Though he’s thrown 14 interceptions, he’s also shown an ability to carry the Bills on his back. Buffalo is 8-3 when trailing at any juncture of a game this season after going 2-6 last year. The Bills’ three losses have been decided by three points or fewer. The team is also battle-tested in having overcome much adversity in closing out the season winning seven straight and matching a single-season record for victories. The Bills have won despite having their schedule disrupted by two major winter storms, and they rallied to close the season by beating New England following an emotionally draining week following Hamlin’s collapse at Cincinnati.\n\nCancel the confetti: Injuries are becoming an issue with the most notable to Von Miller, who significantly muscled up Buffalo’s middling pass rush before sustaining a season-ending knee injury in November. Miller was the missing piece on a defense that had trouble generating pressure at Kansas City in the playoffs last year. Buffalo’s secondary is also thin. Hamlin was starting in place of Micah Hyde, who has been sidelined by a neck injury since September. CB Tre’Davious White is gradually returning to form since being activated in November after missing a calendar year with a knee injury.\n\n“I’m so proud of our organization, our team, just so many people, the way we’ve dealt with so much this year.” — GM Brandon Beane.\n\n3. CINCINNATI BENGALS (12-4). No Lombardi trophies in three Super Bowl appearances: lost to 49ers 26-21 in Super Bowl 16, lost to 49ers 20-16 in Super Bowl 23, lost to Rams 23-20 in Super Bowl 56. Last year: 10-7, No. 4 seed, beat Raiders 26-19 in wild-card round, beat Titans 19-16 in divisional round, beat Chiefs 27-24 (OT) in AFC championship, lost to Rams 23-20 in Super Bowl 56. Second straight AFC North title.\n\nPlan the parade: Third-year QB Joe Burrow has a knack for finding creative ways to win. He passed for 4,475 yards in 16 games and his 35 TDs tied him with Allen for second most in the league behind Mahomes’ 41. He has two 1,000-yard receivers in Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins along with veteran Tyler Boyd and others who have stepped up big. The defense has outstanding edge rushers in Sam Hubbard and Trey Hendrickson along with run-stopping DT DJ Reader and a pair of versatile linebackers in Logan Wilson and Germaine Pratt. The Bengals haven’t lost since Oct. 31 .\n\nCancel the confetti: RB Joe Mixon is tough in fighting for extra yards, but the Bengals running game hasn’t been a huge factor. He topped 100 yards just once this season. The Bengals will have to start backups in both offensive line positions on the right side after injuries to La’el Collins and Alex Cappa. The offense has shown a tendency to be flat for parts of some games. Depth in the secondary also has been an issue.\n\n“We’ve adjusted to what teams are doing to us throughout the year. The beginning of the year was a lot of ups and downs. Then, as the season went on, we made some tweaks and adjustments that have been really good for us both in the run game and pass game, understanding how to win games.” — Burrow.\n\n4. JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS (9-8). One of four teams with no Super Bowl appearances. Last year: 3-14, missed the playoffs. First playoff appearance since 2017, when they lost to the Patriots 24-20 in AFC championship game. Won AFC South in Doug Pederson’s first season as head coach in Jacksonville.\n\nPlan the parade: Trevor Lawrence is a rising star in a conference stacked with young, stellar quarterbacks. At 23, Lawrence is the youngest QB in the playoffs. He completed 66.3% of his passes for 4,113 yards, 25 TDs and eight INTs, in his second season. He also has five rushing scores. Fumbles have been his biggest issue — he has lost nine — but he’s clearly figuring out what it takes to get it done at the most important position in professional sports.\n\nCancel the confetti: Although Jacksonville’s defense has played well down the stretch, allowing a combined 22 points in victories over the Jets, Texans and Titans, that success came against a slew of bottom-tier QBs: Zach Wilson and Chris Streveler for the Jets; Davis Mills and Jeff Driskel for the Texans; and Joshua Dobbs for the Titans. The Jaguars’ pass rush has been mostly suspect against top-flight passers, although takeaways keep coming and LB Josh Allen is showing signs of becoming the dominant force the team expected when it drafted him seventh overall in 2019.\n\n“We’re ready to take over. We’re not in this for no reason. We worked our butts off to get to this point.” — Allen.\n\n5. LOS ANGELES CHARGERS (10-7). No Lombardi trophies in one Super Bowl appearance: lost to 49ers 49-26 in Super Bowl 29. Last year: 9-8, missed the playoffs. First playoff appearance since 2018 when they beat Ravens 23-17 in wild-card round and lost to Patriots 41-28 in divisional round.\n\nPlan the parade: After dealing with injuries for most of the season, the Chargers are finally healthy and playing their best football. Los Angeles has won four of its past five, the offense is showing a semblance of balance with more consistency in the run game and the defense has done a good job of generating pressure on opposing quarterbacks. Justin Herbert threw for at least 300 yards in every game this season.\n\nHold the confetti: Brandon Staley is going into his first playoffs as a head coach. He is one of the most aggressive coaches in the league, but this is the time of year when the wrong decision could have huge ramifications. The Chargers also have one of the worst run defenses in the league. They allowed 5.42 yards per carry, the worst average by any team since the 1970 merger, while 10 running backs had 100-yard games against the Chargers.\n\n“I think that we have a team that is full of quality experiences, and it has been fun to watch this group take shape together to carve its own path here with the Chargers. We get a big opportunity on Saturday to really make our mark.” — Staley on not having a lot of playoff experience on his roster.\n\n6. BALTIMORE RAVENS (10-7). Two Lombardi trophies in two appearances: beat Giants 34-7 in Super Bowl 35 and beat 49ers 34-31 in Super Bowl 47. Last year: 8-9, missed the playoffs. Fourth playoff appearance in five years.\n\nPlan the parade: Since acquiring LB Roquan Smith in a trade, the Ravens are allowing just 14.7 points per game. If they can do that in the playoffs, they can hang with anyone, even if QB Lamar Jackson remains out because of his knee injury he sustained last month. RB J.K. Dobbins has looked refreshed and healthy since returning from injured reserve, averaging nearly 100 yards rushing in four outings. The Ravens also have one of the league’s great clutch performers in a close game in K Justin Tucker. And if Jackson can actually return at some point ...\n\nCancel the confetti: Jackson hasn’t even practiced since his injury in early December when he was tackled by Broncos OLB Jonathan Cooper, so expecting him to provide a major lift is fanciful at this point. Furthermore, QB2 Tyler Huntley hasn’t been totally healthy, either. The Ravens benefitted from a favorable schedule down the stretch and grinded out enough wins to make the playoffs, but asking their defense to dominate against a team such as the Bengals — and the perhaps the Chiefs or Bills later in the postseason — is a different thing entirely.\n\n“This team has been through a lot. There’s been a lot of ups, there’s been a lot of downs, and one thing that we keep on doing is fighting.”—TE Mark Andrews.\n\n7. MIAMI DOLPHINS (9-8). Two Lombardi trophies in five appearances: lost to Cowboys 24-3 in Super Bowl 6, beat Washington 14-7 in Super Bowl 7, beat Vikings 24-7 in Super Bowl 8, lost to Washington 27-17 in Super Bowl 17, lost to 49ers 38-16 in Super Bowl 19.\n\nPlan the parade: The speed of WRs Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle has given defenses fits all season, and Miami’s timing-based offense is at its best when those two find openings over the middle of the field. Hill was second in yards (1,710) and receptions (119) during the regular season and has the playoff experience to help carry Miami’s passing game. Waddle was seventh with 1,356 yards.\n\nHold the confetti: Injuries . The O-line is banged up, and the QB situation seems ever-changing. Tagovailoa was among the NFL’s highest-rated passers all season, but he hasn’t been cleared to return to football activities yet after being diagnosed with a concussion and it’s unclear when the Dolphins will see him back on the field. While Thompson did just enough to lead the Dolphins to a playoff-clinching win over the Jets, Miami’s offense, which was waning even with Tagovailoa toward the end of the season, is severely limited without him.\n\n“There’s still confidence in this team, confidence in this whole building. I feel like you never lose that as a competitor.” — Hill.\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Mark Long and AP Sports Writers Dave Skretta, John Wawrow, Mitch Stacy, Joe Reedy, Noah Trister and Alanis Thames contributed to this report.",

BUFFALO BILLS (13-3). Then, as the season went on, we made some tweaks and adjustments that have been really good for us both in the run game and pass game, understanding how to win games.” — Burrow.\n\n4.

MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, you know, initially I said it's kind of a double standard reaction to this, that somehow this was okay. What happened to Trump was not okay. I think it's interesting, too, that these were turned over a week before the midterm elections and nobody knew that had created the same sin, if you will, that President Trump did.\n\nPENN BIDEN CENTER CHINA TIES DRAWS CRITICISM: WHY DID THE BENEFACTOR GIVE SUCH A 'LARGE CHECK,' ASKS EXPERT\n\nLastly, what I find most disturbing is that the Chinese gave a $30 million donation to the University of Pennsylvania as the Biden Center was standing up. What's the connection between that and the center? Why do they have classified documents and whether it's one document or a thousand, if I did this, one document, I'd be prosecuted and the civil servants, the public servants, lower, (would) absolutely be prosecuted for this.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI think Merrick Garland made the right choice to... have the same standard, to do separate special counsels here, right? But.. You know, where was the outrage on this one, right? His attorney found these documents a week before the midterm elections. Clearly, they had to have notified their client, the president of United States, and yet nothing was done about it and they swept this under the rug. They hid it until it was leaked to the media.",

            "description": "John Jay's Science Research program empowers students to conduct research with a science mentor, analyze data & present their findings.",
            "content": "Her research project, \"Can People Intentionally Wake Up from Sleep?\" under the mentorship of Dr. Remington Mallett, a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University’s Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, earned Sandell a spot as a Top 300 Scholar in the 2023 Regeneron Science Talent Search. The results were announced on January 10. The top 40 Finalists will be announced on January 24.\n\n\"Developing the ability to intentionally wake up from sleep could be particularly helpful for someone with PTSD who relives a traumatic experience in their dreams,\" said Cami. \"If people are able to wake themselves up, they have more control and wouldn’t be afraid of going to sleep.\"\n\nThe Katonah-Lewisboro school district says that Science Research is a rigorous three-year commitment, beginning in the sophomore year. The program empowers young people to conduct their own research with a mentor who is a professional in the student’s field of research, use statistical techniques during their analysis of data and present their findings at competitions and symposia. It’s also fun. Hanging on the door of C103, John Jay’s SciRe classroom, is a poster left over from Halloween. \"Come as your Science Research topic!\" And space is always saved on the busy SciRe calendar for Game Day right before winter recess.\n\nSpring will be a busy competition season, beginning with the Westchester-Rockland Junior Science & Humanities Symposium (WRJSHS) hosted at John Jay High School on January 28. SciRe seniors, and juniors who have already collected data, compete at the regional fair for a place at the State Junior Science and Humanities Symposiums. SciRe students will also participate in the Regeneron Westchester Science & Engineering Fair on March 18 and the Tri County Science and Technology Fair on April 5.\n\n\"It will be very exciting for SciRe seniors to experience the collegiality of a science fair,\" said John Jay’s Science Research teacher Ann Marie Lipinsky. \"When they were sophomores, schools and labs closed and it became exponentially more difficult to work with a mentor in a lab. These students have shown extraordinary commitment, creativity and persistence to complete their projects. This year will be the first year they present their work in a setting other than our own school symposium.\" All of the Science Research seniors gained scientific skills and learned about themselves in the process, according to faculty at John Jay. Maya Nitta is looking forward to studying biomedical engineering in college. (Katonah-Lewisboro School District) Maya Nitta lights up when she talks about her experience working in a medical research lab. \"I loved getting to be hands-on,\" she explained. She is looking forward to studying biomedical engineering in college.\n\n Sophia Lind taught herself to code in R-Studio in order accomplish the statistical computing she needed. (Katonah-Lewisboro School District) \"Analyzing data collected on people who’ve experienced a traumatic injury reconnected me to my early interest in brain science,\" said Sophia Lind, who taught herself to code in R-Studio in order to do the statistical computing required.\n\n \"Science Research affirmed my interest in field biology,\" said Byron Wilson, a runner, biker and fisherman who researched tick populations at Ward Pound Ridge Reservation.\n\n\n\nAlex Einhorn investigated whether seed starting could be a viable aid for increasing a plant’s salt tolerance. (Katonah-Lewisboro School District) \"Now I know I want to continue in the field of science research,\" said Alex Einhorn, who investigated whether seed starting could be a viable aid for increasing a plant’s salt tolerance.\n\n Even in high school, Rachele Bachmann is any employer's dreams. (Katonah-Lewisboro School District) The experience taught Rachele Bachmann the life skill of time management. \"In Science Research, you need to do a little each week, or you fall behind on your hours.\"\n\n Caleb Lee learned skills he can use both in and out of the lab. (Katonah-Lewisboro School District) \"Science Research has taught me how to research through journals, how to learn from other people and how to do my own research,\" said Caleb Lee, whose project looked at the influence of soils on crop yield. \"I’ve also learned a lot about public speaking. This class has set me up for the future.\"",

            "content": "LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Mortgage costs for first-time home-buyers in Britain have risen to their highest since 2008, reflecting a surge in interest rates over the past year, Nationwide Building Society said on Friday.\n\nThe average monthly mortgage payment for a new first-time buyer in the final quarter of 2022 was equivalent to 39% of a single full-time salary after tax, up from 34% the quarter before and the highest since mid 2008.\n\nMortgage costs have risen for first-time buyers despite what Nationwide estimates is a 2.5% fall in house prices between August and December, as well as private-sector wage growth that is running at an annual rate of 7%.\n\nThe Bank of England started to raise interest rates in December 2021 - when they were just 0.1% - and they reached 3.5% last month, the fastest tightening in decades.\n\nFinancial market turmoil caused by Liz Truss's September mini-budget had exacerbated the rise in mortgage rates, Nationwide said.\n\n\"While wider financial market conditions had stabilised by the end of 2022, with market interest rates falling back towards the levels prevailing before the mini-budget, mortgage rates are taking longer to normalise,\" Nationwide economist Andrew Harvey said.\n\nRents are also rising at their fastest pace since Nationwide's records began in 2005, adding to an inflationary backdrop that makes it harder for people to save up to get on the housing ladder.\n\n\"The overall affordability situation looks set to remain challenging in the near term,\" Harvey said.\n\nJapanese bank Nomura forecast on Thursday that British house prices would fall 15% by mid 2024, after rising more than a quarter since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHousing costs vary widely across Britain. While first-time buyers' mortgage payments in northern England and Scotland cost just 24% of a local full-time worker's after-tax salary, a Londoner would pay 67% of salary.\n\nHouse price to earnings ratios are down slightly from a year ago, reflecting falling house prices and faster wage growth.\n\nLondon house prices in 2022 were 9.2 times the average local salary, below a record peak of 10.2 in 2016, while Scotland and northern England have the cheapest housing at 3.4 times earnings.",
